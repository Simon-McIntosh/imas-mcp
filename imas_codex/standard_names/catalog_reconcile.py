"""Diff-by-id reconciler — restore the graph ledger from the published catalog.

The published catalog is a COMPLETE, restorable projection of the graph
provenance ledger.  Restoring the graph from it is a diff-by-id RECONCILE,
never a node-recreating import:

- every entry is MATCHed to its existing ``StandardName`` BY ID — a missing
  node is reported, never recreated (the reconciler issues no
  ``MERGE (sn:StandardName`` node-creation);
- scalar editorial fields (description / documentation / unit) are updated
  only where the catalog and graph differ;
- each entry's ``sources:`` block is replayed through the provenance-rebuild
  binder to restore ``StandardNameSource`` + ``PRODUCED_NAME`` +
  ``FROM_DD_PATH`` / ``FROM_SIGNAL`` (every write gated on the name existing).

This is the sanctioned restore path.  ``sn approve`` is the PR-merge diff path
that folds reviewed curator edits from a merged catalog PR back into the
ledger; it must NOT be used to bootstrap or restore the graph.  This
reconciler is the only path that rebuilds provenance from a published catalog.
