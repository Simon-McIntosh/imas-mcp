"""Symmetric ownership guards for standard-name graph writes.

Prevents the codex LLM pipeline from overwriting editorial content
that has passed the catalog approval gate.
All writers of protected fields call ``filter_protected()`` before
persisting to the graph.

Catalog writers have the inverse constraint: review results and their
authority records belong to the pipeline.  They call
``refuse_pipeline_authority_loss()`` before issuing a write.  Unlike the
editorial filter, this guard refuses the complete batch instead of silently
removing fields from it.
