"""Transport staging directory to an ISNC (imas-standard-names-catalog) checkout.

This module is the second half of the two-step export→publish flow.
It takes a staging directory produced by ``export.py`` and mirrors it
into an ISNC git checkout, creating a commit and optionally pushing.

Publish safety:
- All IO under ``FileLock`` on the ISNC checkout.
- Refusal order, chosen so every refusal names its own cause: manifest and
  entry-file shape, then the ``edge_model_version`` compatibility stamp,
  then the ISN store load, then staged-domain consistency and working-tree
  cleanliness. The stamp is read *before* the store load because the
  installed loader answers a tree cut by an older exporter with a
  field-by-field dump of its manifest model — a dump that points at the
  entry files, while the only thing an operator can act on is re-exporting
  the tree with the current exporter.
- Full-scope: ``rmtree`` + ``copytree``.
- Domain-subset: per-domain ``copy2``.
- Post-copy: ``check_catalog``; a real divergence refuses the publish (the
  finding lands in ``report.errors`` so the command exits non-zero), while an
  uncomparable tree (graph unreachable) is skipped rather than blocked.

    Runs four layers of checks, all upstream from the ISNC release, ordered
    so that the first refusal an operator reads names the cause they can act
    on:

    1. **Shape checks** — manifest exists, ``standard_names/`` populated.
    2. **Compatibility check** — the manifest's ``edge_model_version`` stamp
       matches the shape this module reads. It is refused on its own, ahead
       of the store load: the installed loader validates the manifest as
       part of loading the entries, so a tree cut by an older exporter would
       otherwise surface as a field-by-field dump attributed to the entry
       files instead of a single line naming the stale stamp.
    3. **Structural checks** — ISN's ``YamlStore.load()`` parses every
       entry and runs the catalog-level structural + semantic suite that
       the ``Validate Catalog`` GitHub workflow runs on the published
       repo. Surfacing the issues here means we catch broken names at
       publish time, not at release time.
    4. **Pipeline-specific checks** — public ISN advisory aliases and
       conservatively proven field-at-position relation findings, applied
       across the whole staging set by ``canonical_locus_check``.

    Returns a list of error strings (empty if valid).
