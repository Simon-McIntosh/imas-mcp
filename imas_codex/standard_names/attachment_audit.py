"""Retroactive re-validation of source→name attachments already in the graph.

``workers._is_attachment_consistent`` decides whether a DD source path may
realize a standard name. It is evaluated at COMPOSE time only, so an attachment
written before a rule existed — or written by one of the paths that never
consulted it (legacy source migration, derived-parent seeders, and provenance
rebuilders that MERGE edges directly) — is never revisited. Current migration
paths guard a nonempty explicit cohort before their compare-and-set write, but
historical pairings still need this retroactive pass. A decision cached
durably and never re-evaluated when the deciding logic improves is permanently
wrong: a strike-point source stayed attached to a camera-orientation name on an
ACCEPTED standard name even though the guard rejects that pair today.

This module re-asks the guard's question of every attachment in the graph and
acts on the inconsistent ones, which makes the guard's reach retroactive and
covers every writer at once rather than one call site at a time.

**What happens to a rejected edge.** The attachment is detached — the
``PRODUCED_NAME`` edge, its ``produced_sn_id`` scalar mirror, the DD-side
``HAS_STANDARD_NAME`` projection and the name's ``source_paths`` entry — and the
freed source is returned to ``status='extracted'`` so the generate pool composes
a correct name for it. Nothing is deleted beyond those projections: the source
node, the name node, its ``REFINED_FROM`` chain and its ``DocsRevision``
snapshots all stay, and every detachment is recorded as a
``StandardNameChange`` (``operation='detach_inconsistent_attachment'``) linked
from the name, so the event is auditable and the history is intact.

**Compose semantics for the pairwise rule.** Most of the guard's rules are
order-independent: they look at the one path, the one name and the two units.
One is not — the distinct-vector rule consults ``existing_sources``, and at
compose time (``_process_attachments_core``) that list accumulates only the
sources ALREADY ACCEPTED for the name, so of a mutually-conflicting group the
first is kept and the rest rejected: one representative survives. The audit
reproduces that by walking each name's attachments in a fixed order and
evaluating every one against the accumulated ACCEPTED siblings, never against
the name's whole source set. Handing each member the full set instead would
reject all N of a conflicting group — including the representative compose would
have kept — and strip the name of its entire justification. The order must be
deterministic (paths sorted) because the read returns rows in Neo4j's order:
without it, two passes would detach different members of the same group.
Evaluating against the accumulated set needs no rule taxonomy — an
order-independent rule ignores the sibling list, so its verdict is unchanged.

**Accepted names.** An accepted name losing a source is a real event, not
routine hygiene: the name is catalog-authoritative and may already be published.
Following the precedent of ``sn run --reset-to`` / ``sn prune``, attachments on
``name_stage='accepted'`` names are reported but NOT detached unless the caller
passes ``include_accepted=True``.

**A whole-name wipeout is a NAME defect.** When EVERY attachment of a name is
rejected by the SAME rule, the sources agree with each other and with the DD and
it is the NAME that is the outlier — e.g. an ``…_of_ion_state`` name whose every
source is a species-level ``…/ion/element/atoms_n`` path claims a state
resolution none of its sources has. Detaching them would strip an accepted name
of its justification and rewind every source for paid re-composition to repair
what one ``imas-codex sn edit <name> --rename … --reason …`` fixes. Those names
are classified into ``names_misnamed`` and their attachments are EXCLUDED from
the detach set, so the audit hands the operator a rename worklist instead of
destroying the evidence. Two judgements are baked in:

* **Same rule, not any rule.** A uniform failure is a consensus of sources
  against one name, which is exactly what a rename repairs. Attachments failing
  for MIXED reasons are an incoherent source set — no single rename addresses
  them — so they stay on the ordinary detach-and-recompose path.
* **At least two attachments.** One source is no corroboration: with a single
  attachment there is no evidence about which side is wrong, the recompose costs
  one call, and that lone case is precisely what the detach path was written for
  (a strike-point source on a camera-orientation name). Because the pairwise
  rule now keeps a representative, a wipeout can only be caused by an
  order-independent rule — the uniform-rule reading is well defined.

``names_orphaned`` stays, and is not a duplicate of ``names_misnamed``: it is
measured on the graph AFTER the detach and catches the residue the classifier
deliberately lets through — chiefly the mixed-rule wipeout — so a name that
ended up with no source at all is still surfaced for a human decision rather
than auto-superseded. The two sets cannot overlap, since a misnamed name's
attachments are never detached.

Idempotent: a detached attachment no longer matches the selector, and an
attachment the guard accepts is never touched, so a second pass acts on nothing.

    """Detach ONE source→name realization the consistency guard cannot judge.

    The guard decides mechanical questions — dimensionality, locus/device, vector
    families. It is silent on a *semantic* mis-share: two names that are each
    valid, denote different quantities, and both got attached to one DD path, so
    the exported catalog lists that path under both. Deciding which one the path
    realizes is a physics judgement, and once made it needs an instrument.

    Removes the realization edges (``PRODUCED_NAME``, the DD-side
    ``HAS_STANDARD_NAME``, and the name's ``source_paths`` entry) and rewinds the
    source to ``extracted`` for re-composition ONLY when this was its last live
    name — reusing the reconcile's own detach semantics so a targeted repair and
    the retroactive sweep leave the graph in the same shape. Writes a
    ``StandardNameChange`` so the judgement and its reason survive in the ledger.

    Refuses when the pairing does not exist, or when it is the name's ONLY
    remaining attachment: a name whose every source is wrong is a NAME defect to
    repair with ``sn edit --rename``, never something to orphan by detaching.
    Exception: a derived parent with live children survives losing its last
    realization — its identity is anchored by the ``HAS_PARENT`` structure, and
    accepted derived parents routinely carry no realization at all, so the
    detach returns it to that designed state instead of orphaning it.

    ``terminal_recovery=True`` selects the stricter transactional recovery for
    a source finalized against a terminal target. It bypasses the ordinary
    would-orphan refusal only after proving the exact corrupted binding and
    writes the retry/change ledgers atomically.

    Returns ``{"ok": bool, ...}``; never raises on a refusal.

    The symmetric counterpart of :func:`detach_one_attachment`. That docstring
    states the rationale this extends: the mechanical guard rules on
    dimensionality, locus and vector families, but deciding WHICH name a path
    realizes is a physics judgement, and once made it needs an instrument.
    Detach was the instrument in one direction only, so a source whose correct
    name was identified by hand had no sanctioned way to reach it — the compose
    pool would have to be paid to rediscover the same answer, or the edges
    written by hand outside every guard.

    Writes exactly what the compose pipeline writes for a realization
    (``graph_ops.persist_claimed_attachments``): the ``PRODUCED_NAME``
    provenance edge, the DD-side ``HAS_STANDARD_NAME`` projection the export
    reads, and the name's ``source_paths`` entry, moving the source off
    ``extracted`` to ``attached``. A ``StandardNameChange`` records the
    judgement and its reason exactly as a detach does, so attach followed by
    detach returns the graph to its starting shape with both events in the
    ledger.

    Refuses, writing nothing, when:

    * the DD path is not in the graph, or carries no source node to bind;
    * the target name does not exist, or its stage may not hold a binding —
      a superseded, exhausted or contested name is a terminal identity and
      acquiring a source there is how the terminal-target corruption
      :func:`recover_terminal_attachment` repairs gets created;
    * the source already produces a live name. Re-pointing is a detach
      followed by an attach; conflating them into one verb hides the
      intermediate state where the source belongs to neither name, and that
      state is the whole subject of the judgement;
    * :func:`guard_source_pairings` rejects the pairing. An attach that
      bypasses the mechanical guard is worse than no attach verb, because it
      manufactures precisely the inconsistent edges this module exists to
      remove.
