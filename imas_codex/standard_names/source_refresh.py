"""Idempotent source-drift refresh — re-refine names when their DD source changes.

Wired into ``sn run``. Each standard name records the DD-source snapshot it was
last built against as typed properties on the ``StandardName``. The snapshot
retains effective values alongside raw values, applied and converged resolution
identities, the authority digest, and its typed marker. Every run resolves the
name's producing ``StandardNameSource`` to the *current* ``IMASNode`` (following
``RENAMED_TO`` lineage to the latest identity of the path) and compares the live
node to the complete snapshot. Effective unit, documentation, or path drift
steers a **refine** pass (via :func:`apply_edit`, hint mode, ``axis='docs'``)
whose reason carries the precise delta. Provenance-only drift is re-stamped
without steering documentation. On a rename, the source's ``source_id`` is
re-pointed to the new path. Re-stamping makes an unchanged subsequent run
idempotent.

Captures exactly the changes recorded in the DD graph — unit/documentation edits
(a new DD version) and ``RENAMED_TO`` path moves. It only ever *steers existing*
names; it never composes fresh names. Names in a terminal state (``superseded``)
are skipped.
