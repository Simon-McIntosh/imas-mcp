# Standard-Names Agent Notes

Scoped to `imas_codex/standard_names/**` and `tests/standard_names/**`. Pipeline
architecture, lifecycle axes, pool semantics and CLI flags live in the repo root
`AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture/standard-names.md` — this file holds only what
you need when *editing these files*.

## Graph identity and joins

`StandardName` is keyed by `id`, whose value is the snake-case standard-name
identity; the LinkML class marks that slot as the required identifier
(`StandardName.id`). `StandardNameSource` is keyed
separately by its required `id`, formed as `source_type + ":" + source_id`: DD
sources are `dd:<path>`, while facility signals are
`signals:<facility>:<signal-id>`
(`StandardNameSource.id`). Do not substitute a
plausible property name for either schema-owned key.

| Correct: join a `StandardName` on its identifier | Incorrect: join on an undeclared property |
|---|---|
| `MATCH (sn:StandardName {id: $standard_name_id})`<br>`RETURN sn.id` | `MATCH (sn:StandardName {name: $standard_name_id})`<br>`RETURN sn.id` |

The incorrect query is especially dangerous because it is valid Cypher. Access
to a missing property evaluates to `null`, and a filtering predicate that is not
`true` removes the row, so the query returns an empty result instead of an error
([Neo4j Cypher Manual: working with null](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/working-with-null/)).
Before accepting a zero-row join as a real no-overlap result, report both the
candidate-node count and key coverage in the same query, and fail closed when
the proposed key covers no candidates:

```cypher
MATCH (sn:StandardName)
RETURN count(sn) AS candidates,
       count(sn.id) AS candidates_with_id,
       count(sn.name) AS candidates_with_name
```

The LinkML slot owns relationship direction. Read every row below as
`(source)-[:TYPE]->(target)`; do not infer direction from the English relationship
name, a nearby back-reference property, or whichever endpoint a query starts
from. A zero live count does not override the declaration. For self-relationships
such as `StandardName` to `StandardName`, an authored-direction census and the
same traversal reversed necessarily report the same count because both endpoint
labels are identical; the schema slot remains the only directional authority.

Relationship slots are foreign-key properties too: the property value names the
target node, while the generated graph carries the edge in the direction above.
The table below also includes scalar mirrors and explicit back-references whose
schema prose identifies a `StandardName`. It deliberately excludes free-form
replacement suggestions and generic repair-envelope targets, which need not
identify an existing `StandardName`.

| Schema class | Slots that reference `StandardName` |
|---|---|
| `StandardName` | `StandardName.deprecates`, `StandardName.superseded_by`; `StandardName.links`; `StandardName.refine_collision_name`; `StandardName.references`, `StandardName.parents`, `StandardName.magnitudes`, `StandardName.error_siblings`, `StandardName.predecessor`, `StandardName.successor`, `StandardName.refined_from` |
| `DocsReviewAdmission` | `DocsReviewAdmission.target_id` |
| `DocsRevision` | `DocsRevision.standard_name_id` |
| `StandardNameChange` | `StandardNameChange.to_name` when it is the linked name rather than another changed value |
| `StandardNameSource` | `StandardNameSource.standard_name` (relationship slot), `StandardNameSource.produced_sn_id` (scalar mirror) |
| `StandardNameSourceAuthorityRetirement` | `StandardNameSourceAuthorityRetirement.removed_target_ids` |
| `StandardNameSourceRetry` | `StandardNameSourceRetry.terminal_sn_id` |
| `LLMCost` | `LLMCost.standard_name_ids` |
| `StandardNameReview` | `StandardNameReview.standard_name_id` |
| `PromotionCandidate` | `PromotionCandidate.evidences` |
| `RepairRowIdentity` | `RepairRowIdentity.target_id` when `kind` selects a StandardName target |
| `StructuralNameAuthority` | `StructuralNameAuthority.accepted_name_id`, `StructuralNameAuthority.child_ids`, `StructuralNameAuthority.children` |

The generic back-reference convention is `standard_name_id` for a scalar and
`standard_name_ids` for a multivalued property. `StandardName` itself remains
keyed by `id`; relationship slots with more specific semantics retain the names
declared in the table. The review axis follows the same schema-to-reader rule:
`StandardNameReview.review_axis` uses `name` and `docs`, exactly matching the
paired `_name` and `_docs` slot suffixes.

Aggregation has the same silent-null trap as filtering. `count(property)` and
`count(DISTINCT property)` ignore `null`, so an undeclared or misremembered
property produces zero rather than an error. `DocsRevision` is the worked
example: its back-reference property is `standard_name_id`, and the authored
edge runs from `StandardName` to `DocsRevision`, not the reverse. The exact
schema references are `StandardName.docs_revisions` and
`DocsRevision.standard_name_id`.

```cypher
MATCH (sn:StandardName)-[:DOCS_REVISION_OF]->(rev:DocsRevision)
RETURN count(rev) AS revisions,
       count(DISTINCT rev.standard_name_id) AS revisions_with_the_schema_key,
       count(DISTINCT rev.name) AS silently_zero_wrong_key
```

Before trusting any traversal or foreign-key aggregate, confirm both the slot
name and the authored direction in LinkML, then report the authored and reversed
counts together. The live verification census must cover every row in the
relationship table, including zero-count declarations; omitting empty rows
turns schema drift into apparent success.

## Naming-hygiene keep-list (calibration)

`~/.agents/AGENTS.md` mandates a pre-stage check for plan/stage/bug labels and
changelog prose in filenames, symbols and comments. Its letter class is
deliberately generic (`\b[A-Z][0-9]+[A-Za-z]?\b`), so it is noisy here. These
matches are **legitimate and must be kept** — verified, with the reason:

| Match | Why it stays |
|---|---|
| `S0`–`S11` (`sources/dd_qualifier.py`) | A local numbered rule catalogue, each item with its own description. `tests/standard_names/test_dd_qualifier.py` cross-references them **by id** in ~24 docstrings. |
| `Rule 1`–`Rule 6` (`error_siblings.py`) | Same shape; `test_error_siblings{,_gate}.py` assert on them. |
| `R1`–`R5` (`vocab_token_filter.py`) | Emitted **into** `TokenVerdict.reason` at runtime (`"R4: token contains digits"`); tests assert the substring. Removing them breaks assertions. |
| `D{n}` (compose prompt gallery) | Rendered prompt CONTENT — `test_prompt_completeness` counts `f"D{n} —"` in the rendered system prompt. |
| `rotation_cap` (~40 sites) | A real claim-query kwarg and function parameter. |
| ISN `rc14`/`rc21`/`rc22`/`rc34`/`rc39`/`rc41` | Dependency version contracts recording when a token became valid or a segment opened. |
| `--only <phase>`, `phase_caps`, `LLMCost.phase`, `_PHASE_TO_POOL` | `phase` is a real CLI flag and a real budget/cost dimension here. |
| `W74+`, `W$^{1+}$` | Tungsten charge states in LaTeX descriptions. |
| `T^2`, `m^-2`, `Wb`, `eV`, `A.m^-2` | Physical units. |
| `COCOS 17`, `DDv3`/`DDv4` | Real conventions and DD major versions. |
| `E2E` | "end-to-end". Note the contrast: `E1.`/`E2.` section ids in the *same* file are labels and come out. |
| `noqa` ids (`E402`, `F841`, `S608`, `D401`) | Lint rule codes. |
| `T0 = datetime(...)`, `s1`/`s2`, `m0`/`m1`, `h1`/`h2` | Ordinary locals and constants. |
| `Wave 2D …` in `definitions/clusters/labels.json` | **Physics** — a plasma wave, in two dimensions. Generated cluster labels; a naive `Wave [0-9]` rule corrupts the vocabulary. |

The discriminator that resolved most of the hard cases: **numbering that another
component references by number is load-bearing**; a plan-wide taxonomy id with no
adjacent prose is not. Contrast `S0`–`S11` (local, described, asserted on) with
`_L7_REVISION_MODEL` (a lever id meaning nothing without the taxonomy) — the
first stays, the second gets renamed to what it does.

## Attachment consistency (source → name)

`workers._is_attachment_consistent` is the single guard deciding whether a DD
path may realize a standard name. `attachment_audit.py` re-asks it of every
stored edge and detaches what it rejects, which makes the guard retroactive
across every writer at once.

**Three of its rules were wrong because a vocabulary was hardcoded in codex and
had drifted from ISN.** Expect that failure mode; derive from
`get_grammar_context()` at runtime and add a drift test asserting every ISN token
in the relevant segment is covered:

- rate-ness is expressed by SUFFIX as well as prefix (`..._source_rate`,
  `rotation_frequency`), so a name can be rate-natured without a leading
  `change_in_`/`rate_of_`;
- the DD uses `_dt` for **deuterium–tritium** as well as d/dt — the genuine
  derivative form carries a leading `d` on the differentiated quantity
  (`ddensity_dt_total`, `dphase_dt`);
- state resolution is ISN's `state` segment (`charge_state`, `internal_state`)
  plus the `_state`-suffixed subjects — not a fixed tuple.

**Ordered sample positions never enter a name.** This includes
`first`/`second`/`third` and `start`/`end` endpoint labels whenever the DD
structure proves they index a point or sample. The ordering may remain in the DD
path and source description as provenance, but generation, review, and refine
must all exclude it from identity. Dropping it must preserve the quantity,
carrier, geometry representation, owner, axis, mechanism, and locus. If that
non-ordinal carrier or locus is unavailable in the public grammar, emit the
exact vocabulary gap; never borrow `line_of_sight` or another object's token.
Registered semantic tokens such as `first_wall`, and state/process uses of
`start` or `end`, are not positional and must remain. Consequently
`…/line_of_sight/{first,second,third,start,end}_point/r` shares one name, so
`_vector_fields_conflict` must not treat ordered samples of one object as
distinct vector fields. Genuinely distinct fields (a camera's `direction` vs
`up`) and distinct geometry primitives (`rectangle` center vs `oblique`
reference corner) still conflict.

**A pairwise rule must be applied with compose semantics.** Compose accumulates
only ACCEPTED siblings, so one representative of a conflicting group survives;
passing every sibling to every row rejects the whole group. Applied
order-independently once, that would have stripped 127 names of every source.

**A whole-name wipeout is a NAME defect, not an attachment defect.** When every
source of a name fails the same rule the sources are consistently grouped and the
NAME is wrong — repair with `sn edit`, never by detaching, which would orphan the
name and rewind its sources to paid recomposition.

### Write paths

The guard is consulted at compose time. Paths that migrate a source set onto a
**different** name — the refine-successor migration, and the exclusive rebind /
retarget used by the edit cascade — need it at write time too: the set is
historical but the *pairing* is new, and a new pairing is what the guard exists
to judge. Paths that re-establish an edge against the **same** name (the
provenance reattach, the orphan-parent repair) must NOT be gated: gating a repair
with a rule that never governed the creation turns silent loss into permanent
loss, and the retroactive pass will detach a genuinely bad pair *with* an audit
record, which is the correct order.

A geometry-representation rule is still missing: a path under
`…/geometry/{thick_line,outline,rectangle,oblique,arcs_of_circle}/…` describes a
conductor cross-section, not an optical path, and must not realize a
`line_of_sight`/`beam` name. Both sides are metres, so the dimensionality rule is
silent and the guard currently accepts these.

## Units are DD-authoritative

The model never supplies `unit`, `cocos` or `physics_domain` — all three are
injected post-LLM. Consequences when a unit looks wrong:

- **Fix the DD side, not the name.** `units/dd_unit_exceptions.yaml` is the single
  registry. Most entries only *suppress* a mismatch (the DD is wrong, the name is
  right, and the axis keeps reporting it). Flag `correct_in_graph: true` only when
  the DD contradicts **itself** on one quantity, so there is no single declaration
  to mirror.
- **A registry entry alone is not enough.** The correction is applied by the DD
  build, so an entry added afterwards never reaches already-stored paths.
  `reconcile_dd_unit_corrections` (wired into the `sn run` startup sweep) is what
  makes the registry self-applying.
- **A name carries exactly one unit.** `HAS_UNIT` is cardinality-one in the
  schema, and the guard compares dimensionality — a name holding both `1` and
  `m^-2` admits sources of either. Both writers self-heal, but a terminal-stage
  name keeps the residue forever because nothing recomposes it.
- **Do NOT re-derive a name's unit from its sources in bulk.** ~40 accepted names
  correctly carry a dimensionless unit against a DD path the registry records as
  wrong (charge numbers tagged `e`, unit vectors tagged `m`); a bulk re-derivation
  would clobber every one of them.

## Operators live outside `SEGMENT_TOKEN_MAP` — read the grammar through one accessor

`SEGMENT_TOKEN_MAP` is **not** the whole grammar vocabulary. Operators
(`square`, `inverse`, `flux_surface_averaged`, `derivative_with_respect_to`, …)
are a separate mechanism composing through `operator_token`, so they occupy no
segment slot. A consumer reading only that map cannot see 51 legal tokens and
treats every one of them as an unregistered proposal.

**This has now generated the same bug five separate times**, each fixed at one
site: single-operator gap classification, the state/rate attachment rules, the
compose prompt's operator block, the decomposition classifier's multi-operator
compounds, and the plural-dedup check. Read the grammar through
`segments.grammar_tokens_by_segment()` (per-class tokens, operators included) or
its reverse `grammar_token_index()`. `tests/standard_names/test_vocab_consumers_see_operators.py`
fails on any new module importing `SEGMENT_TOKEN_MAP` that is not listed there
with a reason.

Two sets that look mergeable and are not: `reportable_segments()` is what a gap
may be **reported against** (wider — includes the model-layer slot names
`transformation`/`decomposition`); `known_segments()` is what the **parser** slots
tokens into. Merging them makes the response model reject valid composer output.

A compound spelled with `over` is a **division** — the binary `ratio` operator
over two operands, not a compound base. Never "fix" it by letting the cover walk
step over the word: that stops the token being `absent` while emitting guidance
that folds the operators into one base and silently drops the division. An honest
`absent` costs less than confident wrong guidance.

### Open ISN-side findings (not codex's to fix, no PR — ISN's MCP surface is in flux)

- **Locus tokens reachable by the parser but by no vocabulary enumeration.**
  `active_wall_point`, `beam_path` and `primary` are in the locus registry yet in
  no `SEGMENT_TOKEN_MAP` segment, so a consumer listing the vocabulary cannot emit
  them and they never reach a prompt. Same shape as the `normalizing_qualifiers`
  token `gyrocenter`, which is in no segment either. Pinned per-token in
  `tests/standard_names/test_grammar_vocabulary_drift.py::UNREACHED`.
- **Qualifier ordering structure is not exposed.** `load_qualifier_categories()`
  exists but `get_grammar_context()` never returns it. Note precisely what is and
  is not wrong here: the qualifier *tokens* all reach every prompt seat (they are
  qualifier names), so "qualifier_categories is missing from the prompt" is false.
  What is missing is the **category structure**, while the prompt asks for
  *ordered* qualifier stacking — a plausible driver of ordering errors, and it
  matters more while the qualifier class is being decomposed into ordered
  binding-depth segments.

## Release recipe

Use one committed batch manifest from graph drain through approval. Every numbered item below has a command, an
observable gate, and a stop condition. Immediately before any live effect, re-run these help citations from the
current checkout; all four must exit 0:

```bash
uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn run --help
uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn release --help
uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn approve --help
uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn resolve --help
```

If help and this recipe disagree, stop and update the recipe before operating. Keep `BATCH`, `ISNC`, `PR`,
`PR_NUMBER`, `PR_REPO`, `RC`, `BODY`, `PREVIEW`, `RESTORE`, and `ARTIFACT` bound to one release identity.

### The segment sweep is a scheduled operation, not a rotation side effect

`reconcile_grammar_segments` runs as a startup maintenance step of every unscoped `sn run`, and it covers every
lifecycle stage: a superseded or exhausted identity carries the same drifted segment columns as a live one, and a
published catalog resolves a retired name through that history. 706 of the 2239 terminal-stage names drift, so an
unscoped run rewrites the segment columns of 706 tombstoned identities, each with its own `StandardNameChange`
ledger entry, as a side effect of asking for one review. That write is correct and it is large and reviewable:
schedule it as its own operation behind its own restore point, never discover it inside a rotation.

Until it has been scheduled, an `sn run` dispatched for a single name is

```bash
uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn run --name <standard-name> --only review --skip-global-maintenance
```

`--skip-global-maintenance` is the fence. It bypasses the global startup, background, and post-drain
maintenance writes for a run that already carries an explicit scope, so the sweep is not merely unfired — it is
unreachable, and no after-the-fact proof is needed to establish that. Require it on every scoped single-name
run until the sweep is scheduled.

`--name` is the flag that scopes by standard name, and it is the only one that does. `--focus` reads
name-scoped and is not: it selects **data-dictionary paths**, so a standard-name id handed to it is prefixed
`dd:` and refused at source seeding with `ValueError: cannot capture exact DD snapshot for source(s):
dd:<standard-name>` (`graph_ops.py`, the exact-snapshot capture). Measured 2026-09-03: the route failed in 9
seconds, which is cheap, but the diagnosis was not — the same class of mistake as `sn review --ids`, which
scopes to *IDS* names rather than standard-name ids and matched nothing for 380 seconds. `--focus` stays
correct for the DD-path work it is built for; it is wrong for a name.

Keep the terminal-stage drift census as corroboration, not as the gate. Take it immediately before and
immediately after the run and expect `drifting: 706` unchanged across the pair. Read the drift count alone, not
the terminal population beside it: that population was 2239 when the sweep was ruled in-scope for every stage
and it grows whenever an identity is superseded or exhausted, so a moved `terminal` figure is ordinary and a
moved `drifting` figure is the sweep having fired.

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -c '
from imas_codex.graph.client import GraphClient
from imas_codex.standard_names.graph_ops import _GRAMMAR_SEGMENT_COLUMNS as cols, _parse_grammar
select = ", ".join(f"sn.{c} AS {c}" for c in cols)
with GraphClient() as gc:
    rows = gc.query(
        f"MATCH (sn:StandardName) WHERE sn.name_stage IN $terminal RETURN sn.id AS id, {select}",
        terminal=["superseded", "exhausted", "contested"],
    )
drift = [
    r for r in rows
    if (p := _parse_grammar(r["id"])).get("physical_base")
    and any(p.get(c) != r.get(c) for c in cols)
]
print({"terminal": len(rows), "drifting": len(drift)})'
```

A moved figure means the scoped run wrote through the sweep despite the fence: stop and report rather than
continuing, because the sweep has already run and the remaining question is what else it rewrote — and the
maintenance skip failing to hold is itself the finding. To realign one identity
without touching the other 705, use the name-scoped repair `imas-codex sn realign-segments NAME [--dry-run]` —
that route and the whole-graph sweep share one ledger operation label, so a deliberate single repair stays
queryable beside the scheduled sweep, and neither is ever a hand-written segment update.

### Detached-worktree setup

A detached imas-codex worktree cannot discover the separate catalog checkout through the sibling fallback.
Approval and undo therefore require an explicit binding:

```bash
export IMAS_CODEX_SN_ISNC=/home/ITER/mcintos/Code/imas-standard-names-catalog
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/home/ITER/mcintos/Code/imas-codex/.venv
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
export ISNC="$IMAS_CODEX_SN_ISNC"
```

Use the real checkout path on the current host. Pull its merged `main` before approval, keep it clean, and pass
`--isnc "$ISNC"` when clearer. A missing catalog path is a setup failure, not a credential failure.

### Additive baseline

Catalog `main` starts blank and accumulates approved entries only. The first review PR is a pure addition over
nothing; every later PR is a pure addition over previously approved entries. Approved baseline bytes must remain
identical and disappear from the diff. Never restore the legacy dump. The merge first parent is the additive
baseline; reviewer-edit detection separately compares merged content with the cut-time RC tag.

### Readable review prose belongs to the package writer

A physicist reads the published YAML, so folded descriptions, one blank line between entries, literal Unicode and
column wrapping are release requirements — and every one of them is produced by
`imas_standard_names.yaml_store.dump_catalog_yaml`, which `_write_domain_yaml` hands the whole entry list. The
exporter owns which fields are emitted, their order, the domain header comment, and re-validating the serialized
bytes through the installed entry model. It must never format prose itself, and the `reformatted=0` gate below is
what holds that line.

So when the review surface reads badly, the defect is in the installed package and the repair is a package release
plus a pin bump at both `pyproject.toml` occurrences, never a formatter in `export.py`. That took three pins to
learn: the first writer separated entries correctly but still emitted quoted, escaped scalars, and readable folded
prose arrived only with a later release. Equations, fences and the blank lines inside a documentation block are
deliberately left untouched, so an over-long line is not by itself a defect — check the invariants the writer
actually owns (no `\uXXXX` escapes, no backslash continuations, byte-identity with a re-dump) rather than a column
count.

### Cut-target identity and evidence are fail-closed

**Keep the target out of a dispatch brief.** A release brief may name the batch, the command, and the evidence
required. It must not name or restate the checkout, repository, remote, or path that receives the cut; target
resolution belongs to this runbook and the release tool. When target identity matters, the brief requires the
tool to print its resolution with `imas-codex sn release status`. **Gate:** the brief contains the batch, command,
and evidence contract but no target value, and requires the status fields below immediately before the cut.
**Stop:** a brief names a cut target or asks the command to follow a path or remote stated in the brief.

**Make the release tool name its target before any write.** Run `imas-codex sn release status` immediately before
the cut and read every identity field. **Gate:** it prints the catalog path
`/home/ITER/mcintos/Code/imas-standard-names-catalog` under `Path`, plus `State`, `Latest tag`, `Batch RC`, and
both `Remote` values;
the remotes are `git@github.com:Simon-McIntosh/imas-standard-names-catalog.git` for `origin` and
`git@github.com:iterorganization/imas-standard-names-catalog.git` for `upstream`. **Stop:** any other path,
missing field, or remote mismatch. A wrong resolution is never corrected for the current cut with `--isnc` or an
ad hoc `IMAS_CODEX_SN_ISNC` export: stop, fix the configuration that produced it, start from a clean shell, and
repeat status so the defect remains visible until it is repaired.

**Use the catalog version series as a target canary.** The catalog and grammar repositories have unrelated
version lines. A catalog at `v0.4.0rc4` followed by a computed `v0.10.0rc1` is a target error, not a numbering
surprise. **Gate:** the candidate continues the catalog's own `Latest tag` series. When `State: rc`, the
`Available commands` printed by status are authoritative and continue that series without `--bump`. **Stop:** a
candidate from another series, or any bump flag not offered for the printed state.

**Prove both the positive and the negative from the owning repositories.** Read the candidate branch and tag
from the catalog remote, read the same refs from the grammar remote, and read pull-request state from each
repository's own listing, including both organisation repositories. **Gate:** the catalog remote alone has the
expected `review/$RC` branch and annotated `$RC` tag; the grammar remote has neither; the catalog fork listing has
only the separately authorised fork review pull request, if one was opened; and the organisation listings for
`iterorganization/imas-standard-names-catalog` and `iterorganization/IMAS-Standard-Names` show no pull request for
the cut. **Stop:** any candidate ref in the grammar repository, any unexpected pull request, or evidence inferred
only from the absence of a message in local command output.

**Commit the frozen roster before the worktree can be reclaimed.** The release writes the reproducible batch
identity under `imas_codex/standard_names/manifests/reviews/`, beside tracked roster artifacts, rather than to a
declared report path. Bind `ARTIFACT=imas_codex/standard_names/manifests/reviews/$RC.sn_names.yaml`, stage and
commit that explicit path, then report its byte size and SHA-256. **Gate:** `stat --format='%s %n' "$ARTIFACT"`,
`sha256sum "$ARTIFACT"`, and `git ls-files --error-unmatch "$ARTIFACT"` all succeed at the committed revision.
**Stop:** a missing, empty, untracked, uncommitted, or hash-disagreeing artifact; never leave its preservation to
worktree retention.

**Name the two pull-request targets distinctly.** An `upstream release PR` is the pull request that `--final`
directs into the organisation repository. A `fork review PR` is a distinct review operation against the fork,
even when `sn release` opens it after cutting the fork RC. `No pull request` and `no upstream release PR` are
different states. **Gate:** every authorization and report uses one of those complete names and checks that
repository's own listing. **Stop:** the bare phrases `PR`, `no PR`, or `no upstream PR`, because they do not
establish the state of the other target.

**Resolve every address in a composed body.** A body uses descriptive Markdown links rather than bare addresses,
and every destination is checked against the repository and path it names. **Gate:** each destination returns
HTTP `200` from the named repository and branch, and the body read back from the pull request contains the same
Markdown destination. **Stop:** a bare address, a non-`200` response, a well-formed link into the wrong repository
or branch, or any destination not checked from the posted body.

### Numbered operator runbook

1. **Choose or define the batch manifest.** Reuse a committed token under
   `imas_codex/standard_names/manifests/`, or add a `kind: sn_sources`, `schema_version: 1` YAML file there.
   Group explicit IDS-relative DD paths under `sources.<ids>`. Express a physics-domain batch as the explicit
   source set from that domain, with the domain and derivation under `provenance`; do not defer membership to a
   mutable release-time `--domain` filter. `sn run --batch` and `sn release --batch` consume the same token.

   ```bash
   export BATCH=<manifest-token>
   uv run --no-sync python -c 'import os; from imas_codex.graph.client import GraphClient; from imas_codex.standard_names.sources_manifest import load_sources_file, resolve_batch_token; p=resolve_batch_token(os.environ["BATCH"]); assert p; paths=load_sources_file(p); gc=GraphClient(); q=list(gc.query("MATCH (n:IMASNode) WHERE n.id IN $paths RETURN count(n) AS matched, count(n.physics_domain) AS with_domain, collect(DISTINCT n.physics_domain) AS domains", paths=paths)); gc.close(); print({"manifest":str(p),"sources":len(paths),"unique":len(set(paths)),"graph":q})'
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn run --batch "$BATCH" --dry-run
   ```

   **Gate:** `sources=N unique=N`, `matched=N`, `with_domain=N`, and `domains` is the intended set; dry-run
   prints `Extraction candidates: N` and `Graph writes: 0; claims: 0; LLM calls: 0`. **Stop:** missing, malformed,
   duplicate, zero, unmatched, or out-of-domain sources; count mismatch; or any dry-run write.

2. **Create a restore point and prove the release state.**

   ```bash
   export RESTORE=<absolute-archive-path>
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex graph export --output "$RESTORE"
   test -s "$RESTORE"
   sha256sum "$RESTORE"
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn release status
   git -C "$ISNC" status --porcelain
   BUMP_ARGS=(--bump minor)  # stable state; use BUMP_ARGS=() for the intended existing RC series
   ```

   **Gate:** export exits 0; the archive is non-empty with a recorded SHA-256; status prints the expected `State`,
   `Latest tag`, remotes, and next command; catalog status is empty. Stable state requires `--bump`; RC state
   must name the intended series before `--bump` is omitted. **Stop:** any mismatch or uncertainty about fork
   rehearsal versus upstream review.

3. **Move the standard-names pin before the kind reconcile fires.** Structural `kind` is derived from the
   canonical identity by `derive_kind`, and its answer depends on the base declarations inside the installed
   `imas-standard-names`. `reconcile_standard_name_kinds` runs in the `sn run` startup maintenance sweep (reached
   through `reconcile_grammar_segments`) and rewrites every stored kind that disagrees with the derivation as a
   ledgered `StandardNameChange`. The pin therefore decides what the graph is reconciled *to*, and a sweep under a
   pin whose bases are wrong overwrites correct values graph-wide: measured on 2026-09-02, a sweep touched 181 live
   names and flipped 45 correct vectors (`momentum`, `torque`, `torque_density`) to scalar because those three
   bases were still registered scalar in the pinned release. The corrected release had to be pinned first, and the
   repair cost a second unscoped drain. Bump both `pyproject.toml` occurrences with `uv.lock` resolved to match,
   then census the live set through the same predicate the reconcile uses.

   ```bash
   grep -n 'imas-standard-names==' pyproject.toml
   uv run --no-sync python -c '
   from imas_standard_names import __version__ as isn
   from imas_codex.graph.client import GraphClient
   from imas_codex.standard_names.kind_derivation import derive_kind
   from imas_codex.standard_names.ledger import LIVE_NAME

   with GraphClient() as gc:
       rows = list(gc.query(f"MATCH (sn:StandardName) WHERE {LIVE_NAME} RETURN sn.id AS id, sn.kind AS stored"))
   controls = {base: derive_kind(base) for base in ("momentum", "torque", "torque_density", "electron_temperature")}
   disagree = [row for row in rows if row["stored"] != derive_kind(str(row["id"]))]
   print({"isn": isn, "live": len(rows), "with_kind": sum(1 for row in rows if row["stored"]),
          "disagreements": len(disagree), "controls": controls})
   '
   ```

   Run it before and after the first unscoped `sn run` of the batch. The startup lines `Grammar synced to ISN
   <version>` and `reconcile_standard_name_kinds: refreshed N stored kind(s)` must account for the difference.
   **Gate:** the installed `isn` equals both pinned occurrences; `live` equals `with_kind`, so a zero is not a
   missing-property artifact; each vector-base control derives `vector` and the scalar control derives `scalar`;
   and `disagreements` is `0` once the drain has run. **Stop:** a pin mismatch, a control deriving the wrong kind,
   a `live`/`with_kind` gap, or any remaining disagreement. Cut no candidate on a graph whose kinds disagree with
   their identities, and never reach for a scoped drain or `--skip-global-maintenance` to get past this: those
   bypass the whole sweep, so the disagreement survives and is published.

4. **Preflight the additive cut and author the PR text.** The submitting agent authors a short title and a
   two-to-five-sentence body naming the facility, manifest, published count, deliberate exclusions, review
   instruction, catalog `REVIEWING.md`, and preview shape. Never enumerate entries or narrate unresolved defects.

   ```bash
   export BODY=<decisions-only-body.md>
   rg -n 'REVIEWING\.md' "$BODY"
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn release --batch "$BATCH" --dry-run \
     "${BUMP_ARGS[@]}" -m "<batch in words>" \
     --pr-title "<short batch title>" --pr-body-file "$BODY"
   ```

   **Gate:** exactly one live review-contract link; dry-run exits 0 and reports `Review batch <RC>`,
   `Batch size: M name(s)`, a frozen artifact, no errors, no approved-baseline failure, and source accounting with
   zero unexplained paths. **Stop:** any unresolved source, validation, semantic, byte-identity, prose, or accounting
   finding. Never use `--skip-gate` to cross a failed gate.

5. **Cut the candidate.** `--target auto` sends an RC batch to a fork PR; add `--final` for the upstream review.
   In both cases the branch pushes to the fork. `--no-pr` is only for a deliberately tagged in-work build.

   ```bash
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn release --batch "$BATCH" --target auto \
     "${BUMP_ARGS[@]}" -m "<batch in words>" \
     --pr-title "<short batch title>" --pr-body-file "$BODY"
   git -C "$ISNC" ls-remote origin "refs/heads/review/$RC" "refs/tags/$RC"
   ```

   **Gate:** release prints the same RC, `M`, artifact, fork branch, cut-time tag, and PR URL; `ls-remote` returns
   one branch and one tag; upstream `main` remains at its recorded SHA. **Stop:** wrong target/ref, upstream-main
   change, identity mismatch, or published prose differing from `$BODY`.

6. **Gate the cut before calling it a review candidate.** Two per-entry properties are invisible in the release
   summary and both break the reviewer's surface silently: an entry whose `physics_domain` is not a `PhysicsDomain`
   member is rejected by validation and withheld, and an entry whose `kind` disagrees with `derive_kind` publishes a
   structural claim the identity contradicts. Read them out of the tag the cut just pushed — local in `$ISNC`
   because the release ran there, so fetch `refs/tags/$RC` first only when reading from another checkout —
   together with the readability invariants the writer owns, so the candidate is judged on its published bytes.

   ```bash
   uv run --no-sync python -c '
   import itertools, os, re, subprocess, yaml
   from imas_standard_names.grammar import PhysicsDomain
   from imas_standard_names.yaml_store import dump_catalog_yaml
   from imas_codex.standard_names.kind_derivation import derive_kind

   isnc, rc = os.environ["ISNC"], os.environ["RC"]
   show = lambda *a: subprocess.run(["git", "-C", isnc, *a], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout
   files = [f for f in show("ls-tree", "-r", "--name-only", rc).split() if f.startswith("standard_names/")]
   domains = {d.value for d in PhysicsDomain}
   fields = ("entries", "domain_invalid", "kind_disagreement", "escapes", "continuations", "reformatted")
   counts = dict.fromkeys(fields, 0)
   for f in files:
       text = show("show", f"{rc}:{f}")
       counts["escapes"] += len(re.findall(r"\\u[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}", text))
       counts["continuations"] += sum(1 for line in text.splitlines() if line.endswith("\\"))
       body = "".join(itertools.dropwhile(lambda line: line.startswith("#"), text.splitlines(keepends=True)))
       entries = yaml.safe_load(body) or []
       counts["reformatted"] += dump_catalog_yaml(entries) != body
       for entry in entries:
           counts["entries"] += 1
           counts["domain_invalid"] += entry.get("physics_domain") not in domains
           counts["kind_disagreement"] += entry.get("kind") != derive_kind(entry["name"])
   print({"files": len(files), **counts})
   '
   ```

   **Gate:** `entries` equals the published count the release reported, `domain_invalid=0`, `kind_disagreement=0`,
   `escapes=0`, `continuations=0`, and `reformatted=0`. **Stop:** any non-zero. A domain outside the enum is a
   classification defect fixed with `sn reclassify`, never by widening the emitted value; a kind disagreement means
   the pin-before-reconcile gate has not been satisfied on the live graph, so go back rather than publish it; and a
   non-zero `reformatted` means prose is being formatted between the writer and the file, which is the one thing
   the exporter must never do.

7. **Hand off review without weakening machine ownership.** Reviewers may edit only the standard name and its
   description/documentation. Unit, kind, status, source binding kind/ref/version, identity roles, structure,
   ordering, and formatting are machine-owned. To hold an entry, request changes and keep the PR unmerged; do not
   delete it or alter machine fields. After merge, a failed reviewer edit is held as `contested`.

   ```bash
   gh pr checks "$PR"
   gh api "repos/$PR_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER" --jq '.body | contains("REVIEWING.md")'
   gh api "repos/$PR_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER" --jq ".body | contains(\"https://${PR_REPO%%/*}.github.io/${PR_REPO#*/}/pr-$PR_NUMBER/\")"
   gh api "repos/$PR_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/files" --paginate --jq '[.[].status] | unique | join(",")'
   curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$PREVIEW"
   ```

   **Gate:** required checks pass; both body queries print `true`, file statuses print only `added`, and `$PREVIEW`
   returns `200` with PR-identical content. `sn release` writes and reads back the derived Pages address; catalog CI
   enforces it. Same-repository PRs have no bot comment; only external forks retain the artifact comment. **Stop:** CI, ownership, additivity, link,
   preview, or hold failure. Rebuild with `gh workflow run catalog.yml --repo "$PR_REPO" -f
   pull-request-number="$PR_NUMBER"` or `gh run rerun <run-id>`; require `success`. Never close/reopen the PR.

8. **Merge and run the fail-closed approval preflight.**

   ```bash
   gh pr view "$PR" --json state,mergeCommit --jq '.state + " " + .mergeCommit.oid'
   git -C "$ISNC" pull --no-rebase origin main
   git -C "$ISNC" status --porcelain
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn approve --pr "$PR" --dry-run
   ```

   **Gate:** `MERGED <sha>`; clean catalog `main`; dry-run prints `Batch: M name(s)`, `Mode: dry run`, the
   expected edit count, `blocked=0`, and `unmatched=0`. **Stop:** any refusal. It proves wrong lifecycle,
   unmatched identity, or prior provenance/approval before any write; fix the cause and repeat, never bypass or
   hand-edit graph state.

9. **Fold the merged review into the graph.**

   ```bash
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn approve --pr "$PR"
   uv run --no-sync python -c 'import os; from imas_codex.graph.client import GraphClient; gc=GraphClient(); q=list(gc.query("MATCH (sn:StandardName) WHERE sn.catalog_pr_number = $pr AND sn.name_stage IN [\x27approved\x27,\x27contested\x27] RETURN count(sn) AS folded, sum(CASE WHEN sn.catalog_pr_url IS NOT NULL AND sn.catalog_merge_commit_sha IS NOT NULL AND sn.catalog_reviewer_actor IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS complete_provenance", pr=int(os.environ["PR_NUMBER"]))); gc.close(); print(q)'
   git -C "$ISNC" tag -l "$RC" --format='%(contents:subject)'
   uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn approve --pr "$PR"
   ```

   **Gate:** first approval ends `Approval complete`; `M = auto-approved + accepted + contested + staged for
   review`; blocked, unmatched, and quarantined are zero; provenance prints `folded=complete_provenance`; tag
   subject starts `graph-merged:` and its annotation names PR, batch, outcomes, and prior tag; repeat approval
   exits nonzero with `already carries the fold-back contract tag`. **Stop:** any count/provenance/receipt mismatch,
   catalog push without receipt, or non-refusing repeat.

10. **Adjudicate contested proposals explicitly.**

    ```bash
    uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn status --contested
    uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn resolve <name> --override --reason "<substantive expert justification>"
    ```

    **Gate:** a held entry remains listed `contested` without mutation; override prints `proposal applied →
    approved`, materializes the exact reviewed proposal, sets `docs_stage='accepted'`, stores the exact reason in
    `contested_resolution`, and preserves provenance. **Stop:** non-contested target, empty/procedural reason,
    wrong materialized bytes, or provenance change.

11. **Prove approved and contested rows are frozen.** Capture ID-ordered `properties(sn)` JSON before and after
    ordinary unscoped work.

    ```bash
    export SNAPSHOT=<frozen-before.json>
    uv run --no-sync python -c 'import json; from imas_codex.graph.client import GraphClient; gc=GraphClient(); q=list(gc.query("MATCH (sn:StandardName) WHERE sn.name_stage IN [\x27approved\x27,\x27contested\x27] RETURN sn.id AS id, properties(sn) AS properties ORDER BY id")); gc.close(); print(json.dumps(q, sort_keys=True, default=str))' > "$SNAPSHOT"
    sha256sum "$SNAPSHOT"
    uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn run --flush --cost-limit <conservative-cap>
    ```

    Repeat the snapshot command to a different file and hash it. **Gate:** row counts and SHA-256 match while the
    pipeline processes at least one non-frozen item as a positive control. **Stop:** frozen delta, frozen claim/write,
    provider/parameter failure, or zero positive-control work; equality without a firing control is absent evidence.

12. **Undo only a rehearsal.** Before approval record the graph census, merged-PR tree, artifact hash,
    upstream-main SHA, and exact cut-time annotated tag object. A real accepted release stops here and is never
    unwound.

    ```bash
    uv run --no-sync imas-codex sn approve --undo --pr "$PR"
    ```

    **Gate:** demotions equal the approved/contested cohort; graph counts return to baseline; repeat the provenance
    query and get `folded=0`; all frozen-batch `catalog_*` fields are null; receipt absent; exact cut-time RC tag
    restored (or stable receipt deleted); catalog tree equals the merged-PR tree; artifact hash and upstream `main`
    unchanged. Reviewer wording and its internal change remain graph history. **Stop:** any mismatch. Never improvise
    Cypher/tag repair or infer an inverse for a receipt-less catalog mutation; that needs separate authorization.

The failures, repairs, measurements, and report inventory live only in the cumulative
[rehearsal evidence record](../../docs/evidence/archive/sn-west-review-rehearsal-landed.html#fold-back-rehearsal).

## The catalog is not the source of truth

The graph plus the review pipeline is. Catalog-origin names
(`origin='catalog_edit'`, `source_types=['catalog']`) came from one bulk import of
this pipeline's own earlier output and sit at `status='draft'`; they are an old
method to be resolved through review, not authoritative content to protect.

This makes the `origin='catalog_edit'` exemption in
`supersede_prior_source_names` a defect rather than a safeguard: it stops the
one-live-name-per-source dedup from folding an imported name, which is why one
coordinate axis resolved to a single name while another stayed split across two.

## The refinement budget is charged per ATTEMPT

`chain_length` is lineage depth: it counts successors that PERSISTED. A refine
attempt can fail before any write — the proposed identity is already taken
(`find_name_key_duplicate`), the persistence fence refuses the successor, the
candidate fails grammar validation — and every one of those leaves lineage
depth untouched. Gating claim eligibility, escalation, or exhaustion on it
therefore re-selects the same name on every poll and re-bills it: one measured
run spent 822 model calls and $54.7 on 14 names and produced one accepted name.

`refine_attempts` is the budget. It is charged on each verified claim, before
the model call, and a successor inherits it so the cap bounds the lineage. Read
it through `REFINE_NAME_ATTEMPTS_SPENT`, never `chain_length`.

Two consequences worth keeping straight:

- **A collision is decided, not transient.** The refiner proposes the same
  successor identity every cycle — measured across two model vendors — and
  refinement may not take an occupied identity, because merging carries
  source-migration semantics that belong to `sn edit`. `stop_refine_name_attempt`
  parks such a name immediately with `refine_collision_name` recorded. A model
  or provider error is the opposite case and keeps the rotations that remain.
- **Recovery differs by whether new information arrived.** `sn rescore` buys a
  fresh quorum draw on the SAME name and deliberately does NOT refund rotations
  (refunding re-opens the paid loop for a name that scores low again); a
  name-steering `sn edit --hint` is new information and refunds them.

The docs axis has no such defect and needs no counter: `persist_refined_docs`
rewrites in place, so every attempt lands and `docs_chain_length` always
advances. Do not "harmonise" the two axes by giving docs an attempt counter.

## Acceptance

Never hand-accept, and never edit graph text with Cypher. Acceptance is earned
only through the RD-quorum review pool; corrections go through `sn edit`
(`--hint` to steer regeneration, `--rename`/`--docs` to replace and go straight
to review). `--stage-only` stages many for one batch review — the budget-efficient
path for a bulk repair, since compose is free and review is the only paid stage.

The single sanctioned structural accept is `ENRICH_PARENTS` for placeholder
derived parents, which the quorum systematically penalises for being abstractions.

## Exact-source compose steering

Use `sn source-hint <exact-dd-path> --hint ... --reason ...` only before an
eligible DD source without a live name binding composes. It is not a source
mutation: DD snapshot, unit, COCOS, domain, identity, and grammar validation
remain authoritative. Preview with `--dry-run`; replacing an open hint requires
`--replace`.

The write is claim-fenced compare-and-set. A missing or non-DD source, active
claim, non-`extracted` state, attempt cap, live binding, or unacknowledged open
hint is a refusal, not a reason to bypass the CLI with Cypher. An open hint rides
pooled compose and is consumed atomically only when that exact source binds a
name. Retry, failure, interruption, claim expiry, validation rejection, and
collision preserve it. Use `sn run --focus <same-exact-path>` to fence the
subsequent work; model choice comes from the configured compose seat unless the
run explicitly overrides it.

Do not confuse the three operator surfaces: `sn retry --reason` audits why a
blocked source may attempt again, `sn source-hint` steers the next successful
binding of one exact source, and `sn edit <name> --hint` steers an existing name
through review. `rejected` is reserved in the hint-status schema; no current CLI
transition sets it.
