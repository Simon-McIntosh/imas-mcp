    4. Compute next version tag
    5. Git commit in ISNC
    6. Create git tag
    7. Push commit + tag to remote

    Parameters
    ----------
    isnc_path:
        Path to the ISNC git checkout.
    message:
        Release message (used for git tag annotation and commit).
    staging_dir:
        Staging directory. If None, uses default from settings.
    bump:
        Version bump type (major, minor, patch). Required for first
        release or when on a stable tag.
    final:
        If True, finalize current RC to stable release.
    remote:
        Git remote to push to. Default: origin for RC, upstream for final.
    dry_run:
        Validate and report without making changes.
    skip_export:
        Skip the export step (use existing staging content).
    export_kwargs:
        Additional kwargs for run_export (e.g., min_score, domain).

    Returns
    -------

    """Mint → export → assemble → freeze → branch → tag → optional PR, in one call.

    A single orchestrating step so the frozen sn-names artifact, the pushed RC
    catalog, and the PR stay in lock-step. The focus file drives the batch: an
    sn-sources file resolves each exact manifest path to its terminal name, and
    an sn-names file is used directly (schema dispatch). The resolved set is
    frozen under ``manifests/reviews/<rc>.sn_names.yaml`` (RC-tagged, the
    traceable key) and the PR number/URL back-filled once the pull request is
    opened when ``open_pr`` is true. The RC tag is always created and pushed to
    the fork at cut time.

    The RC version carries the batch identity as semver build metadata
    (``v0.2.0rc66+<label>``, derived from the manifest — see
    :func:`batch_build_metadata`), and that one string names the tag, the
    ``review/<rc>`` branch, and the frozen artifact, so a batch RC is
    recognisable as such from its version alone.

    ``exporter``/``publisher``/``pr_creator``/``github_client`` are injectable
    so the flow is testable against a local bare repo with no live GitHub call.
