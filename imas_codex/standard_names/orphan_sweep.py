"""Stage-aware orphan recovery for the SN refine pipeline.

Periodically reverts StandardName nodes stuck in transient stages (e.g.
'refining') that have stale claimed_at timestamps. Mirrors the discovery
CLI orphan-sweep pattern but applies stage-aware predecessor reverts.

Predecessor-stage mapping
-------------------------
``name_stage='refining'``  →  revert to ``'reviewed'``
``docs_stage='refining'``  →  revert to ``'reviewed'``

For defense in depth, also clear stale ``claim_token``/``claimed_at``
on non-refining StandardName and StandardNameSource nodes.
