"""Export validated standard names from the graph to a staging directory.

Reads StandardName nodes from the Neo4j graph, applies quality gates,
and writes YAML files matching the ``imas-standard-names-catalog``
layout: ``<staging>/standard_names/<domain>/<name>.yml`` plus a
``<staging>/catalog.yml`` manifest.

This module is the first half of the two-step export→publish flow.
The staging directory produced here is consumed by ``publish.py``
(transport to ISNC repo) and ``preview.py`` (local site render).

    - ``name_stage IN ['accepted', 'approved']`` — accepted RC candidates and
      PR-approved names are exportable; superseded/internal attempts are not.
    - ``docs_stage = 'accepted'`` — excludes nodes whose documentation has
      not yet passed the docs review loop (skipped when *names_only*).
    - ``validation_status = 'valid'`` — excludes quarantined nodes.
    - ``review_quorum_shortfall IS NULL`` — excludes a name accepted while its
      reviewer chain had not reached a verdict. A quorate review clears the
      marker, so an accepted node still carrying one arrived by a path that
      did not consult it, and publishing it would ship exactly what the
      quorum gate withheld.

      — excludes unresolved and historical score-only decisions from full

      review authority.

    When *batch* is given (a review-batch export), the name gate becomes
    ``name_stage = 'approved' OR sn.id IN batch``: the already-approved catalog
    plus exactly this batch, so the PR diff is additive. The other gates
    (validation, docs) still apply. When *batch* is None the full accepted∪

    Parameters
    ----------
    staging_dir:
        Path to the staging directory. Created if it doesn't exist.
    min_score:
        Minimum ``reviewer_score_name`` for inclusion (default 0.65).
    bound_adjacent_half_width:
        Scores below ``min_score`` by no more than this measured review swing
        are excluded as ``bound_adjacent`` rather than ``below_name_score``.
    include_unreviewed:
        Include names without a ``reviewer_score_name``.
    min_description_score:
        Optional secondary threshold on description sub-score.
    domain:
        Restrict export to a single physics domain.
    force:
        Write staging tree despite gate failures.
    skip_gate:
        Skip gate entirely (requires ``force=True``).
    gate_only:
        Run the gate and report without writing YAML.
    gate_scope:
        Gate scope: ``"all"`` or ``"domain"``.
    override_edits:
        List of name IDs to reset from ``catalog_edit`` to
        ``pipeline`` origin. Pass ``["all"]`` to override all.
    cocos_convention:
        COCOS convention for the manifest (default 17).
    include_sources:
        Populate ``sources`` field in each entry with the graph
        provenance (``StandardNameSource`` nodes). Default ``True``
        (useful debug info); set ``False`` for a clean catalog export.
    final:
        When True, applies strict quality gates (dangling links
        block export).  When False (default, RC mode), dangling
        documentation links are advisory only.
    review_batch:
        Standard-name ids of a review batch. When given, the export is
        additive — ``approved`` catalog ∪ this batch — and the batch id-set is
        stamped into ``catalog.yml`` (``export_scope: review``, ``review_batch``)
        so the SPA can render a PR-scoped view. When None, a normal RC export.
    manifest_sources:
        Exact source membership and terminal target projection from cohort
        minting. When supplied, every row is reconciled as emitted, excluded,
        or documented non-nameable in the export report.
    isnc_dir:
        ISNC checkout used for the protected-field comparison. When omitted,
        the configured checkout is resolved; if none is available Gate D is
        skipped rather than emitting unverifiable rows.
