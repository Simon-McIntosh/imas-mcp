      graph function in a worker thread and returns the result wrapped in
      a dict (``{"items": [...]}``), or ``None`` on empty.
    * **process adapter** — unpacks the claimed batch and delegates to the
      corresponding ``process_*_batch`` async function, forwarding the
      shared :class:`BudgetManager` and ``stop_event``.

    After construction, backlog throttle wrappers are applied to the upstream
    generate/refine pools (generate_name, generate_docs, refine_name,
    refine_docs) so they pause when their downstream review queues exceed the
    configured cap.  ``enrich_parents`` is intentionally NOT throttled.

    *drift_scope_run_id* gives the docs adapters a first claim against names
    reset by this run's startup refresh. That bounded claim drops the regular
    name-score gate for those accepted names only; an empty result falls back
    to the ordinary unscoped backlog.

    The ``enrich_parents`` pool drains the *existing* placeholder-derived-parent
    backlog, synthesising a children-grounded description and accepting the
    parent STRUCTURALLY (``name_stage='accepted'`` with an inherited score —
    it skips REVIEW_NAME, see ``persist_enriched_parent``).  It is a name-axis
    producer: it runs under ``names_only`` and ``flush`` (draining existing
    work, not seeding new), is dropped under ``docs_only``, and survives

        ``interval`` seconds, comfortably inside the TTL.

    """Run the pool-based ``sn run`` orchestrator.

    Uses six concurrent worker pools that pull work from the graph
    independently and share a single :class:`BudgetManager`.

    When *names_only* is ``True``, the three docs pools
    (generate_docs, review_docs, refine_docs) are excluded so
    only name generation / review / refinement run.

    When *flush* is ``True``, the generate_name pool is excluded
    and auto-seeding is skipped.  Only review / refine / docs
    pools run, draining existing work without composing new names.

    Startup sequence:

    1. Create ``SNRun`` node and ``BudgetManager``.
    2. **Reconcile-once at startup** — ``reconcile_standard_name_sources()``
       runs in a worker thread, completing before any pool issues its
       first claim.  This clears stale claims and revives sources
       whose upstream entities reappeared.
    3. Build 6 :class:`PoolSpec` objects (generate_name, review_name,
       refine_name, generate_docs, review_docs, refine_docs) with
       adapter closures and backlog throttle wiring.
    4. Delegate to :func:`~imas_codex.standard_names.pools.run_pools`
       which runs all pools concurrently with cooperative shutdown.
    5. Finalize ``SNRun`` with the actual stop reason and graph-derived
       cost.

    Args:
        cost_limit: Maximum LLM spend in USD.
        compose_model: Optional configured model override for pooled name
            composition. When absent, the production ``sn-compose`` seat is
            resolved by the worker.
        time_limit_s: Maximum wall-clock time in seconds.  When set,
            a background timer fires ``stop_event`` after this duration
            for a graceful shutdown.  ``None`` (default) means no time
            limit — only ``cost_limit`` and manual Ctrl-C stop the run.
        min_score: Review threshold.  Names with
            ``reviewer_score_name < min_score`` are routed to the
            refine_name pool; those above are eligible for review.
            Defaults to ``DEFAULT_MIN_SCORE`` when *None*.
        rotation_cap: Maximum REFINED_FROM chain depth before exhaustion.
            Defaults to ``DEFAULT_REFINE_ROTATIONS`` when *None*.
        escalation_model: Higher-capability model for final refine attempt.
            Defaults to ``DEFAULT_ESCALATION_MODEL`` when *None*.
        review_name_backlog_cap: Max pending review_name items before
            generate_name / refine_name pause.  Defaults to
            ``REVIEW_NAME_BACKLOG_CAP`` when *None*.
        review_docs_backlog_cap: Max pending review_docs items before
            generate_docs / refine_docs pause.  Defaults to
            ``REVIEW_DOCS_BACKLOG_CAP`` when *None*.
        source: ``"dd"`` or ``"signals"`` — scopes reconciliation.
        only_domain: Deprecated — use *domains* instead.
        domains: Tuple of physics domain names to seed.  When empty
            (default), all eligible domains are auto-seeded.
        max_sources: Cap on total StandardNameSource nodes seeded in
            the auto-seed sweep.  Prevents runaway queue growth.
        stop_event: Cooperative shutdown signal (set by the CLI harness).
        loop_state: Optional :class:`SNLoopState` for Rich progress.
        pending_fn: Optional callable ``() → dict[str, int]`` mapping
            pool names to pending counts.  When provided, a background
            watchdog polls this every 5 seconds to keep
            ``PoolHealth.pending_count`` current in headless / ``--quiet``
            mode where the Rich display ticker is absent.
        display: Optional :class:`~imas_codex.standard_names.display.SN6PoolDisplay`.
            When provided, the run's authoritative ``BudgetManager`` spend
            ledger (per-pool ``phase_spent`` + the graph-reconciled total)
            is wired into the display before the final render, so the COST
            gauge and ``print_summary`` report what was actually billed
            rather than the systematically undercounted sum of emitted
            ``on_event`` payloads (fanout / retry sub-charges emit no
            display event).
        reconcile_only: Run the complete graph-maintenance sequence, including
            structural parent lifecycle repair, then return before constructing
            any operational worker pool.
        skip_global_maintenance: Bypass graph-wide startup, background, and
            post-drain maintenance while retaining the ordinary scoped worker
            pools and run audit. Requires *scope_run_id* and is incompatible
            with maintenance-only modes.
        only_pool: Restrict operational work to exactly one canonical worker
            pool. Broad ``--only`` phases leave this unset.
        scope_size_hint: Known positive cardinality for a bounded graph scope.
            Exact-name callers provide it to avoid recounting the graph.
