"""Async workers for the standard-name build pipeline.

Five-phase generate pipeline:

    EXTRACT → COMPOSE → VALIDATE → CONSOLIDATE → PERSIST

- **extract**: queries graph for DD paths or facility signals, builds batches
- **compose**: LLM-generates standard names from extraction batches
- **validate**: validates names against grammar via round-trip + fields check
- **consolidate**: cross-batch dedup, conflict detection, coverage accounting
- **persist**: writes consolidated names to graph with provenance

Workers follow the ``dd_workers.py`` pattern: each is an async function
with signature ``async def worker(state, **_kwargs)`` that updates stats,
marks phases done, and respects ``state.should_stop()``.

# A bare ``triangularity`` conflates the boundary scalar
# (``equilibrium/.../boundary/triangularity``) with the flux-surface radial
# profile (``.../profiles_1d/triangularity``) and is not itself a measurable
# quantity. When the composer omits the surface locus we inject it
# deterministically from the source DD path so the leaf is always
# surface-explicit (``triangularity_of_plasma_boundary`` /
# ``triangularity_of_flux_surface``) — never bare. This also de-conflates the
# boundary and profile siblings into distinct names instead of one ambiguous
# parent. Derived structural parents are reached later by stripping
# qualifiers/projections, never by stripping a base's defining surface — so no
# bare shape-parameter parent is ever admitted (see ``parents.py``).
#
# WHICH bases require the surface is codex POLICY; the tokens themselves are
# ISN's. The policy is validated against the live ISN ``physical_base``
# vocabulary at load, so a token ISN renames or retires drops out of the set and
# is reported as drift rather than silently persisting as a spelling that
# matches nothing. ISN's own naming guidance states the requirement ("Use
# elongation_of_plasma_boundary or elongation_of_flux_surface, not elongation")
# but exposes no machine-readable flag for it, so the selection lives here.
