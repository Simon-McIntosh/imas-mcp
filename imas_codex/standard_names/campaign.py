"""Budgeted, resumable documentation-refinement campaigns for accepted names.

A campaign selects accepted standard names by a *defect predicate* — banned
prose in their documentation (typical values, estimator recipes, procedural
padding) and/or deterministic audit findings — materialises a reviewed
manifest, then drains the selection through the NORMAL docs pools in fixed,
budgeted batches.

Each batch:

1. lifts audit quarantine on its members so the fix can become visible
   (the docs pools skip quarantined names — an accepted-but-quarantined name
   would otherwise stay invisible after refinement);
2. snapshots every member's current docs to a :class:`DocsRevision` and resets
   the docs pipeline, stamping a fresh scope ``run_id`` — reusing the same
   mechanism the family-curative wave uses (:func:`mark_members_for_regen`),
   so every refinement is reversible;
3. drains ONLY that scope through the six-pool orchestrator
   (``sn run --docs-only --flush --scope-run-id <id>``) via an injected
   callable, so this module carries no pool machinery;
4. re-validates the touched names against the banned-prose policy — a name
   whose refreshed docs still trip the grep-audit is re-quarantined, a clean
   name is confirmed valid;
5. records a campaign change event per touched name for traceability;
6. is checked against a convergence gate — acceptance below threshold,
   banned prose reintroduced, or name-identity drift halts the campaign for
   root-causing rather than churning.

Nothing here composes new names or renames anything: docs campaigns never
touch name identity (renames stay individual ``sn edit`` decisions), and there
is no full-catalog regeneration mode. All accepts drain through the normal
review pools; the campaign only selects, snapshots, and gates.

The selection logic is pure (:func:`match_target`) so it is unit-testable
without a graph, and every graph interaction in the runner is an injectable
callable so the orchestration is testable against a mock graph.
