"""The ``sn edit`` engine — steered proposals ride the SN pipeline.

``imas-codex sn edit <sn>`` lets a human or agent attach a proposal to a
``StandardName`` that rides the normal generate → review → score pipeline
instead of hand-editing graph text directly. Four modes:

- **hint** — a steering direction is injected into generate/refine prompts;
  the pipeline still composes the candidate.  Re-enters at ``generate``.
- **rename** — a full replacement name skips generation and rides straight
  into name review.  Re-enters at ``review_name``.
- **docs** — full replacement documentation skips generation and rides
  straight into docs review.  Re-enters at ``review_docs``.
- **kind** — an exact in-place structural repair derived from the unchanged
  identity, validated through ISN, previewed before an explicit apply, and
  recorded without changing already-reviewed wording or lifecycle stages.

Locked decisions (see the SN edit-engine plan):

- Edit-steering fields are scalar properties on ``StandardName`` (see
  ``imas_codex.graph.models``: ``EditMode``, ``EditOrigin``, ``EditStatus``,
  ``EditScope``).
- Review receives ONLY the edit reason (intent) — never the proposal
  pre-approved. The reviewer still independently scores the candidate.
- A shared-base leaf edit (renaming a segment a leaf's siblings also carry)
  blocks.  It is never promoted automatically to a structural parent; a
  parent-scoped edit must be requested and reviewed explicitly.
- Cascade descendants never individually re-enter LLM review — the ROOT
  rename is the reviewed decision; descendants follow atomically once it is
  accepted (see :func:`imas_codex.standard_names.graph_ops
  .persist_reviewed_name` and :func:`imas_codex.standard_names.cascade
  .cascade_descendants_of`).

Validation-parity call graph (edit entry → accepted, gate by gate)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Every edit-origin artifact clears exactly the gates a pipeline-generated
name clears — there is no privileged accept path:

- **rename** — ``apply_edit`` → ``_apply_rename``:
  1. ISN grammar round-trip on the literal requested name
     (``cascade._isn_round_trip_ok``) — same round-trip the validate gate
     and the cascade apply run; a grammar-invalid name is refused up front.
  2. id-collision check against the live graph.
  3. shared-base / sibling desync guard (no leaf-to-parent promotion).
  4. ``persist_refined_name`` mints the ``drafted`` successor, then
     ``_stamp_successor_validation`` runs the FULL name-admission gate
     (:func:`imas_codex.standard_names.workers.validate_name_candidate`:
     grammar round-trip + ISN Pydantic/semantic/structural/canonical/
     description layers + post-generation audits) and stamps
     ``validation_status``.  A
     quarantined successor is skipped with a 0.0 review by the review
     worker and can never reach ``accepted`` — identical to a quarantined
     pipeline candidate.
  5. name review (``review_name`` pool → ``persist_reviewed_name``) scores
     it; ``score >= min_score`` accepts.
  6. on acceptance of a ``family``/``subtree`` rename, the descendant
     cascade is preflighted (round-trip + uniqueness of every descendant
     id) BEFORE the acceptance commits; any conflict refuses the
     acceptance (``name_stage`` stays ``reviewed``) and renames nothing.
- **docs** — ``apply_edit`` → ``_apply_docs``: ``name_stage='accepted'`` +
  ``docs_stage in (accepted, exhausted)`` preconditions, then
  ``protection.filter_protected`` (catalog-edit docs require
  ``--override-edits``), then ``persist_refined_docs`` → the ``review_docs``
  pool scores the replacement — the same docs gate a pipeline docs
  candidate rides.
- **hint** — ``apply_edit`` → ``_apply_hint``: resets the producing
  sources / docs so the name is REGENERATED through the ``generate_name`` /
  ``generate_docs`` pools; it therefore rides the pipeline's own gates by
  construction (nothing edit-specific to validate).

``--scope family`` never widens a leaf edit through ``HAS_PARENT``.  Grammar
ancestry groups structural forms but does not prove that their sources share
an owner, representation, or repair intent.  Cascade-bearing parent edits are
reviewed only when the parent itself is the explicit target.

        A structural parent is named by the grammar peel, and the enrich-parents
        pool lifts it out of 'pending'; it is not renamed by hand.

    no description
        The name was never composed. Steering generation with a hint is the

    Exactly one of ``hint``/``rename``/``docs`` selects the mode. ``reason``

    axis/scope/origin); returns an :class:`EditPlan` with ``blocked`` set
    for runtime graph-state refusals (unknown target, ineligible stage,
    shared-base desync, cascade conflicts).

    ``override_edits`` / ``include_accepted`` (rename mode, family/subtree

    rename descendants that are catalog-edited (``origin='catalog_edit'``)

    in the dry-run plan and block the edit rather than being silently
    clobbered. The recorded values are re-read at acceptance time so the
    post-review cascade reproduces exactly the operator's choice.

    ``refine`` (default ``True``) declares whether the attached proposal may
    be automatically refined (its wording rewritten) if review scores it
    below threshold. ``sn approve`` attaches human-approved catalog wording
    with ``refine=False`` so the proposal is stamped ``edit_refine=false`` —
    a durable review-only marker recording that the wording must be scored
    as-is and never silently mutated. It does not alter the attach itself;
