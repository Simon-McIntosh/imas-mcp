Generate Standard Names for the following IMAS Data Dictionary paths.

{% include "sn/_grammar_reference.md" %}

## Core rules

- **Unit is authoritative** and comes from the DD `HAS_UNIT` relationship.
  Do not include unit in your output — it is injected at persistence time.
  Use it only to disambiguate the physical quantity.
- **Choose registered IR segments; never spell a free-form name.** The parser
  and composer are authoritative for ordering and joins. Every base, qualifier,
  projection, locus, process, and operator must come from the injected closed
  registry; emit a vocabulary gap when the exact identity is unavailable.
- The value-provenance facets `measured`, `reconstructed`, and `reference`
  collapse to one base-quantity name. They are relationship metadata, never
  name segments.
- Shape parameters such as triangularity, elongation, and squareness require an
  explicit surface locus; a bare shape parameter is forbidden.
- Error companions wrap the parent identity with the registered uncertainty
  operator. Never coin a separate error base name.
- **No unit strings, no IDS names, no method names** in the Standard Name.
- **Follow controlled vocabulary**: use `poloidal_magnetic_flux` not
  `poloidal_flux`; `electron_temperature` not `electron_temp`; etc.

## Tool-calling policy (variant C)

You have access to three tools that fetch additional context **only when
you need it**. The goal is to keep the prompt lean and let you pull in
siblings, reference exemplars, or version history on demand rather than
front-loading all of it:

- `fetch_cluster_siblings(cluster_id)` — returns names already assigned
  to paths in the same semantic cluster. Use when you are unsure whether
  a similar name has been established.
- `fetch_reference_exemplar(concept)` — returns a published exemplar
  Standard Name that matches a concept (e.g. `"electron temperature"`).
  Use to confirm controlled-vocabulary choices.
- `fetch_version_history(path)` — returns DD version change history for
  one path. Use when the path description references a renamed or
  repurposed field.

**Budget:** at most 2 tool calls per batch. Prefer to emit the name
directly if the context is obvious.

## Grounding policy

Each path entry below must provide its DD-authoritative unit and rich enriched
source description. Ground the identity on that description, not on a terse DD
clause or a deterministic-parent placeholder. A generic path or leaf never
licenses a generic Standard Name: the missing carrier, surface, subject, or
process is usually stated in the enriched description. If either required
grounding field is absent, do not guess from the path; report the missing
context in the rationale.

## Output

**You do NOT output a `standard_name` string.** You fill individual IR segment
fields. Code assembles the canonical name via ISN's `compose()` function.

Return a JSON array of objects. Each object includes:
- `path`: the DD path
- `base_token`: irreducible base quantity from the registry
- `base_kind`: `"quantity"` or `"geometry"`
- `projection_axis`: for vector/coordinate projections (null if none); `base_kind` determines component vs coordinate
- `qualifiers`: list of qualifier tokens (empty list if none)
- `locus_token`, `locus_relation`, `locus_type`: for postfix locus (null if none)
- `process_token`: for `_due_to_` (null if none)
- `operators`: ordered outer-to-inner operator items (`[]` if none)
- `rationale`: one sentence citing the physical quantity and any tool call evidence
