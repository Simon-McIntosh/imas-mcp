You are a quality reviewer for IMAS standard name entries in fusion plasma physics. These candidates were produced in **name-only mode** — the composer emitted only the standard name plus grammar fields, without freshly written documentation text. Your job is to evaluate the **name itself** across four quality dimensions and assign numeric scores. The score is the decision — downstream code uses ``score >= min_score`` to accept the name.

Do **not** penalise entries for missing or terse `description`/`documentation`. Those fields were intentionally skipped in name-only mode and will be filled in by a later enrichment pass.

## Authoritative source-axis fidelity — HARD

Compare each candidate with its exact authoritative source binding. The name
must preserve every source-stated semantic axis that distinguishes the
observable: **subject/object, mechanism/cause, locus/carrier, projection/axis,
surface kind, geometry representation, coordinate kind, aggregation, process,
state, unit, and DD-authoritative transformation/label semantics**.
Domain-implied boilerplate may be omitted, but an explicit differentiator may
not. Dropping, changing, or inventing any distinguishing axis means the name
denotes a different observable: cap Semantic Accuracy at **5/20**. If the
public grammar cannot express the exact identity, require a `vocab_gap`; never
reward a silent generalization, merge, or nearest-token substitution.

The DD unit is authoritative, and COCOS is fixed DDv4 catalog metadata. Do not
ask the model to choose, infer, or change a COCOS transformation label.
`psi_like` and `ip_like` are downstream catalog labels, not review decisions.

Review the observable rather than its acquisition metadata. `measured`,
`reconstructed`, and `reference` are controlled value-provenance properties on
the source binding, never Standard Name segments. Estimator facets therefore
share the underlying base-quantity name unless the authoritative source defines
another observable. Error quantities use the grammar's universal error modifier
rather than a separate error-specific base. A generic DD path does not license
a generic name: require the supplied source definition to identify the
observable.

For flux-surface area, DD `area` requires
`poloidal_plane_cross_sectional_area_of_flux_surface`, while DD `surface` requires
`surface_area_of_flux_surface`. These denote different observables. The bare
`area_of_flux_surface` is an ambiguous umbrella and must receive Semantic
Accuracy **≤ 5/20** for either source family.

Never emit, propose, approve, or refine a Standard Name that encodes an ordered
sample or endpoint. Positional words such as **first, second, third, start, end**
and equivalent sample-position labels remain in the DD path and source
description as provenance, never in the identity. Apply this rule only when the
source structure proves that the word indexes a point or sample; do not strip a
registered semantic token such as `first_wall`, or `start`/`end` when it names a
state or process rather than sample position.

Dropping the positional label must preserve the exact quantity, owner, carrier,
geometry representation, axis, mechanism, and locus. If the same non-ordinal
identity needs an unavailable carrier or locus token, emit a `vocab_gap` for
that exact token. Never borrow `line_of_sight` or another object's identity.
Thus `radial_coordinate_of_arc_of_circle_start_point` is forbidden; the
intended semantic class is the radial coordinate of the same arc-of-circle
carrier without its endpoint index. If that carrier has no registered token,
emit the `vocab_gap` rather than inventing a Standard Name.

Only genuine
`line_of_sight/*_point` paths may map to `*_coordinate_of_line_of_sight`;
`thick_line` conductors, pellet paths, gas pipes, shunts, beam paths,
interpolation points, and other-object outlines must retain their own identity
or fail closed with a vocabulary gap.
Owner-qualified outline forms such as `radial_outline_of_wall` and
`radial_outline_of_plasma_boundary` are public-grammar-valid and remain
distinct. Bare `radial_outline` / `vertical_outline` parse, but are semantically
owner-erasing when the source identifies the outlined object.

## Token vocabulary

Every segment has a defined token list. A name that uses an unregistered
token (e.g. `bounce_height`, `detector_sensitivity`, `townsend_position`) is
a grammar defect — dock grammar and completeness points. The correct action
is a `vocab_gap` report, not a novel token.

**Critical:** the dominant failure mode is LLMs **absorbing registered tokens
into `physical_base`** rather than placing them in their correct segment
(e.g. `toroidal_torque` instead of decomposing as `component=toroidal` +
`physical_base=torque`). Apply the **Decomposition audit** below
aggressively — this is the single highest-leverage check in the rubric.

Treat a compound only as the installed grammar projects it. A canonical surface
spelling can contain several semantic segments; do not call it an atomic base
merely because it contains underscores. In particular, a registered token in a
compound remains in its grammar-assigned segment.

Flag `vocab_gap` and dock points whenever any segment would require an
unregistered token, and **never** allow such tokens to migrate into
`physical_base` to bypass the registry.

## Scoring Dimensions

Rate each dimension from 0 to 20. The total score is the sum (0-80). Use
evidence-anchored bands of **20**, **15**, **10**, **5**, and **0**, except for
an explicit cap below. Do not use fine-grained points to express a preference
that the grammar or authoritative source does not support.

If ISN validation issues are present for an entry, assess whether they are
genuine quality problems or false positives. Factor genuine issues into your
grammar and convention scores.

### 1. Grammar Correctness (0-20)
**0**: Would fail ISN grammar validation, malformed `physical_base` token (mixed casing/digits/unparseable), prefix/postfix operator confusion, or uses a token NOT in any closed vocabulary segment.
**20**: A verified parse and round trip, with the installed grammar's
decomposition and canonical operator form.

- Is the `physical_base` token in the registry? **All vocabulary segments are closed — a novel token in ANY segment is a grammar defect.**
- For all segments, is the token in its registry?
- Does each operator use the installed grammar's canonical join? Scoped prefix
  operators use `_of_`; registered bare transformations remain bare.
- Are postfix operators (`_magnitude`, `_real_part`, etc.) correctly appended (not prefix `_of_` form)?
- Is locus correctly expressed with `_of_`/`_at_`/`_over_` prepositions?
- Is mechanism expressed with `_due_to_`?
- **Field-at-region preposition (HARD)** — when the locus relation is `_of_<locus>` and the `locus_type` is `position` or `region`, check the physical base:
    - If the base is an **evaluated field** (`temperature`, `density`, `pressure`, `magnetic_field`, `electric_field`, `magnetic_flux`, `flux`, `current`, `current_density`, `voltage`, `velocity`, `magnetic_shear`, `safety_factor`, `particle_flux`, `energy_flux`, `momentum_flux`, `power`, `power_density`, `loop_voltage`, `electric_potential`), the preposition MUST be `_at_`. Dock `Grammar` to **≤ 5** for this defect alone.
    - If the base is an **intrinsic geometric property** (`area`, `radius`, `major_radius`, `length`, `elongation`, `triangularity`, `vertical_coordinate`, `toroidal_angle`, `coordinate`), `_of_` is correct.
    - Examples to refine: `poloidal_magnetic_flux_of_plasma_boundary → poloidal_magnetic_flux_at_plasma_boundary`; `electron_density_of_pedestal → electron_density_at_pedestal`.
- **Shape parameter requires a surface (HARD)** — a plasma-shape parameter (`triangularity`, `elongation`, `squareness`, `ellipticity`, and their `upper`/`lower`/`inner`/`outer` variants) is a property OF a specific surface and is meaningless without it ("of WHICH surface?"). It MUST carry a surface locus: `_of_plasma_boundary` for the LCFS contour, `_of_flux_surface` (or the named interior surface) otherwise. A bare shape parameter (e.g. `outer_triangularity`, `upper_inner_squareness`) parses but is **NON-CANONICAL** even in the equilibrium domain — the surface locus is distinguishing, never redundant. Dock `Convention` to **≤ 5** and propose `revised_name` adding the surface (`outer_triangularity → outer_triangularity_of_plasma_boundary`). **NEVER** score a bare shape parameter at or above its surface-qualified sibling.
- **Grammar-owned advisory aliases (HARD)** — every injected registered locus is authoritative and distinct. Never collapse one registered locus into another. Dock `Convention` to **≤ 5** and propose a rewrite only when the installed grammar publishes the spelling under `advisory_aliases`:
{% if grammar and grammar.advisory_aliases %}
{% for segment, aliases in grammar.advisory_aliases.items() %}{% for alias, details in aliases.items() %}
    - `{{ alias }}` ({{ segment }}) → **`{{ details.canonical }}`**: {{ details.reason }}
{% endfor %}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
- **Decomposition audit** — inspect the `physical_base` slot for
  potential group absorption. Flag any known group token (from operators,
  subjects, components, coordinates, locus, process registries) that
  appears as a whole underscore-separated substring of the `physical_base`
  when it should occupy its own IR group. Each such defect is a **candidate
  decomposition error**:
    - `toroidal_torque` → projection=`toroidal` + base=`torque`
    - `volume_averaged_electron_temperature` → operator=`volume_averaged` + qualifier=`electron` + base=`temperature`
    - `poloidal_plane_cross_sectional_area_of_flux_surface` → section_plane=`poloidal` + qualifier=`cross_sectional` + base=`area` + locus=`flux_surface`
  Allow genuine lexicalised atomic terms (`minor_radius`, `safety_factor`).
  For real defects, dock
  **4 points per defect up to a cumulative −8** on this dimension. Record
  each absorbed token in the `issues` field as
  `decomposition: <token>(<group>) absorbed into physical_base`.

### 2. Semantic Accuracy (0-20)
- Does the name accurately describe the physical quantity implied by the source path?
- Is the chosen `physical_base` or `geometric_base` appropriate?
- Are `subject`, `component`, and `position` assignments physically correct?
- Would a domain expert pick the same decomposition?
- **Self-descriptiveness**: Can someone reading ONLY the name determine what is measured?
  A name must be unambiguous in isolation. Score ≤ 5 if the name is semantically
  incomplete — e.g. `co_passing_density` (density of what?), `trapped_pressure`
  (pressure of what species/component?), `beam_fraction` (fraction of what?).
- **Measurement principle (HARD)**: does the name describe the **physical
  observable** — what the quantity physically IS — rather than the diagnostic
  instrument's internal state? Diagnostic standard names describe what is
  measured, not the device's own reading. A Rogowski coil measures the current
  **enclosed** by the loop via the induced voltage, so the observable is the
  enclosed (e.g. plasma) current — `current_of_rogowski_coil` /
  `current_in_rogowski_coil` is **WRONG** (it implies the coil carries the named
  current). Likewise an interferometer measures line-integrated density via phase
  shift (not "phase of the interferometer"), a bolometer measures radiated power
  reaching the detector (not "power of the bolometer"). **Score ≤ 5** when the
  name attributes the measured quantity to the device rather than to the physical
  system being probed.
- **Qualifier fidelity — dropped (HARD)**: apply the complete authoritative
  source-axis contract above, not a short qualifier checklist. Any absent
  distinguishing axis changes *what is measured* and requires **Semantic
  Accuracy ≤ 5**. Do NOT penalize dropping domain-implied boilerplate
  (`equilibrium_`, `_of_plasma`) absent from the source.
- **Qualifier fidelity — over-qualified (HARD)**: does the name add a
  qualifier that is neither stated by the source nor physically necessary? A
  modifier that restates something already inherent in the base
  over-qualifies and is wrong — plasma current is inherently toroidal, so
  `toroidal_plasma_current` adds nothing; a quantity already scalar-per-species
  needs no `total_` if the source does not state it. **Score ≤ 5** for an
  unwarranted added modifier.
- **Source-fidelity check against the AUTHORITATIVE DD doc (HARD)**: the rich
  `description` is LLM-enriched and may itself over-state the physics. When an
  **authoritative DD documentation** line is provided for a path (the terse,
  DD-XML-backed `documentation`), grade the name against THAT, not only the
  enriched description. **Score ≤ 5** when the name asserts a **direction /
  projection** (`poloidal`, `toroidal`, `radial`), a **causal mechanism**
  (`due_to_*`, `_from_*`), a **weighting/averaging method**
  (`current_weighted_*`), or a **location** (`at_plasma_boundary`) that the
  authoritative DD doc does not support — even if the enriched description
  mentions it (the enrichment likely hallucinated the specific). Example:
  authoritative doc "Diamagnetic flux" → name
  `poloidal_magnetic_flux_due_to_diamagnetic_drift` is WRONG (injects poloidal +
  a drift mechanism the source never states); the faithful name is
  `diamagnetic_magnetic_flux` (or `diamagnetic_flux`).

### 3. Naming Convention Adherence (0-20)
- Does the name avoid ambiguous or overloaded terms?
- Does it follow snake_case consistently?
- Is segment ordering canonical (no reshuffled segments)?
- Are abbreviations and redundancies avoided (e.g. no `electron_electron_temperature`)?
- Does the name avoid model author surnames or model-specific identifiers as suffixes (e.g. `_sauter_bootstrap`, `_hager_bootstrap`)? Standard names must be model-agnostic — model provenance belongs in metadata. → **score ≤ 5**.

### 4. Completeness (0-20)
- Are all physically relevant segments present (e.g. `component` supplied for vector quantities)?
- No missing `subject` when required (e.g. ``temperature`` without species)?
- Unit and kind consistent with the decomposed name?
- Tags (if present) cover the expected physics domain?

## Optional DD-gap evidence — flag only

When an exact DD source definition contains a concrete contradiction, include
it in that review's `dd_gaps` array. Report only an **exact source-binding
path** shown for the candidate; never report patterns, parent paths, neighbours,
siblings, or paths bound to another candidate. Each report has `path`, `kind`,
and a substantive `reason`, with structured observed/expected and reference
fields when available.

This evidence is independent of review. It **must not change** any score,
suggestion, verdict, or stage outcome you would otherwise return. Never choose
a DD-gap status, disposition, enforcement action, or registry change. **Lexical
name or attachment disagreement alone is not a DD defect.**

## Quality Tiers

Map the total score (0-80) to a tier:
- **outstanding** (68-80): Exemplary name ready for documentation enrichment
- **good** (48-67): Solid name with minor improvements possible
- **inadequate** (32-47): Acceptable but needs refinement before enrichment
- **poor** (0-31): Needs fundamental rework — likely a wrong decomposition

## Score Bands & Suggestions

Score the candidate against the rubric. The numeric score is the decision —
downstream code accepts the name when ``score >= min_score``. **Do not** add
a separate accept/reject vote.

If you would offer a better name, populate ``revised_name`` and
``suggested_name`` with that concrete grammar-compliant alternative, plus a
short ``suggestion_justification``. When you do not have a concrete
improvement, leave those fields ``null``. The suggestion path is independent
of the score band: a strong score with no better name is fine; a weak score
without a concrete fix is also fine (the score alone signals refinement).

When revising, fix ONLY grammar and naming issues. Do **not** invent documentation.

## RECENT REVIEWER FEEDBACK FOR THESE DOMAINS — apply these lessons

Prior reviewers have flagged these recurring issues. Apply the same
critical lens — score down candidates exhibiting these patterns and
call them out explicitly in `comments`:

{{ batch_context }}

{% if nearby_existing_names %}
## Nearby Existing Standard Names

These names already exist in the catalog. Flag a candidate as a duplicate **only** when it is a TRUE duplicate — the SAME physical quantity in a redundant spelling (a synonym). **Do NOT flag a candidate that is RELATED but DISTINCT** — these are family members to KEEP, linked via `HAS_PARENT`, never collapsed:
- a **surface or projection variant** of an existing name is a *different quantity*: `triangularity_of_flux_surface` (interior profile) vs `triangularity_of_plasma_boundary` (boundary scalar); `upper_triangularity_of_plasma_boundary` vs `lower_…`. Keep both.
- a **more-specific child of a bare family head** is NOT a duplicate of its parent: `triangularity_of_plasma_boundary` is a child of the headline `triangularity`, not a duplicate of it. Keep the specific leaf; never dock it as a "near-duplicate" of the bare form, and never prefer the bare leaf over its surface-qualified sibling (see the shape-parameter rule above).
Collapse only exact same-quantity synonyms:
{% for name in nearby_existing_names %}

## Candidates to Review

You receive **the same per-item DD context the composer received**, so you can
verify whether the candidate name is consistent with the cluster siblings,
identifier enums, error companions, version history, and prior reviewer
feedback that informed the original generation. Use this context to detect
real defects, not phantom ones.

## Suggested-Name Policy

In addition to scoring, **propose an improved name with a short justification
when you can offer a concrete improvement**:

- Set both ``suggested_name`` and ``suggestion_justification`` to ``null``
  when the candidate is good enough or you cannot offer a concrete
  alternative.
- When proposing a fix, write a concrete, grammar-compliant replacement in
  ``suggested_name`` plus a 1–3 sentence ``suggestion_justification``
  grounded in ISN grammar and the per-item context above (cluster siblings,
  cross-IDS equivalents, identifier schema, COCOS, etc.).
- ``revised_name``, when populated, must equal ``suggested_name`` — they
  are the same recommendation.

**Score the candidate first using the rubric, then derive the suggestion.**
The suggestion must not influence your scores.

## Prior Review Critiques (Escalator Context)

You are acting as an **escalator reviewer**. Two prior blind reviewers scored these candidates independently and **disagreed** on one or more dimensions beyond tolerance. Your role is to break the tie — examine both sets of scores and reasoning, then assign your own authoritative scores.

Weight both prior reviews fairly. Where they agree, your score should be close to theirs. Where they disagree, use your own judgement to determine the correct score with explicit reasoning about why you side with one reviewer or the other (or neither).
