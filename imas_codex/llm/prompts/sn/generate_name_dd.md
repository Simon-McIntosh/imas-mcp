---

Name the **physical or geometric quantities** represented by the following
IMAS Data Dictionary paths. Each standard name describes the underlying
physics — NOT the DD path, IDS section, or measurement instrument.
Multiple DD paths share one standard name only after their complete semantic
identities are proven equivalent. Similar units, leaves, or geometry shapes do
not establish equivalence.

**Subject–base separation rule:** Species and entity qualifiers (electron,
ion, neutral, fast_ion) go in the `subject` segment, NOT fused into
`physical_base`. Example: subject=electron + physical_base=temperature →
`electron_temperature` — but `temperature` is the base, not
`electron_temperature` as a monolithic token.

## PREFERRED VOCABULARY FOR THIS DOMAIN — reuse unless concept is genuinely different

The following standard names already exist in this physics domain and have been
validated. **Reuse** these terms and naming patterns unless the concept you are

## Unit Policy

The `unit` field for each path is pre-populated from the IMAS Data Dictionary
(`HAS_UNIT` relationship). It is **authoritative and final**:
- Do NOT include unit in your output — it will be injected from the DD at persistence time
- Use the provided unit to inform your naming (e.g., "eV" tells you this is an energy/temperature quantity)
- "dimensionless" means the quantity is genuinely unitless (e.g., safety factor, elongation)

## Authoritative source-axis fidelity — HARD

For every candidate and attachment, compare the exact authoritative DD source
binding with the complete name identity. Preserve every source-stated semantic
axis that distinguishes the observable: **subject/object, mechanism/cause,
locus/carrier, projection/axis, surface kind, geometry representation,
coordinate kind, aggregation, process, state, unit, and DD-authoritative
transformation/label semantics**. Domain-implied boilerplate may be omitted,
but an explicit differentiator may not. A candidate or attachment that drops,
changes, or invents any distinguishing axis is wrong even when it parses or
resembles an existing name. If the public grammar cannot express the exact
identity, emit a `vocab_gap`; never silently generalize, merge, or substitute a
nearby registered concept.

The supplied unit is authoritative, and COCOS is fixed DDv4 catalog metadata.
Do not choose, infer, or change a COCOS transformation label. `psi_like` and
`ip_like` remain downstream catalog labels, not composer output.

Flux-surface area is not one generic family: DD `area` is
`poloidal_plane_cross_sectional_area_of_flux_surface`, while DD `surface` is
`surface_area_of_flux_surface`. Never emit or attach either source family to
the ambiguous umbrella `area_of_flux_surface`.

## Optional DD-gap evidence — flag only

When the supplied DD metadata itself contains a concrete contradiction, you may
add a typed object to the top-level `dd_gaps` array. Report only an **exact
claimed DD path** shown in this batch (or another exact source-binding path
explicitly shown for the same claimed item). Never report a wildcard, parent,
semantic neighbour, sibling, or other unclaimed path.

Each object contains `path`, `kind`, and a substantive `reason`; when the
evidence supplies them, also include `observed_dd_version`, `observed_value`,
`expected_value`, `evidence_rule`, and the paired `reference_path` /
`reference_value`. `kind` must be one of `unit_defect`, `self_contradiction`,
`doc_mismatch`, `type_wiring`, `missing_declaration`, or
`rename_inconsistency`.

This is evidence only. Flagging a DD gap **must not change** the candidate,
attachment, skip, vocabulary-gap, score, verdict, or stage outcome that you
would otherwise return. Do not emit a status, disposition, enforcement choice,
or registry change; graph triage owns lifecycle and curated registries own
enforcement. **Lexical name or attachment disagreement alone is not a DD
defect.**

## Common Anti-Patterns (AVOID these)

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| `electron_temp` | `electron_temperature` | No abbreviations in `physical_base` |
| `langmuir_probe_electron_temperature` | `electron_temperature` | Method independence — measurement device is metadata, not name |
| `filtered_electron_density` | `electron_density` | Processing is metadata — `filtered_` is not a name segment |
| `electron_temperature_core` | `core_electron_temperature` | A zone is a canonical prefix segment |
| `Te` | `electron_temperature` | No symbol abbreviations |
| `electron_temperature_in_eV` | `electron_temperature` | Unit is never part of the name |
| `safety_factor_q` | `safety_factor` | No symbol suffixes |
| `plasma_current_IP` | `plasma_current` | No symbol suffixes |
| `current_from_passive_loop` | `current_of_passive_loop` | `_from_` implies causation; intrinsic device association uses the canonical postfix locus |
| `poloidal_flux` | `poloidal_magnetic_flux` | Use controlled vocabulary term; no synonymous short forms |
| `area_of_flux_surface` for DD area or DD surface | `poloidal_plane_cross_sectional_area_of_flux_surface` for DD area; `surface_area_of_flux_surface` for DD surface | Surface kind is load-bearing: poloidal enclosed cross-section and swept toroidal surface are different observables |
| `reconstructed_faraday_rotation_angle` | `faraday_polarization_angle` | Drop provenance; use the registered Faraday-polarization quantity |
| `geometric_minor_radius` | `minor_radius` | DD section prefix leaking into standard name |
| `flux_surface_averaged_elongation` | `elongation` | Elongation is a geometric property of a contour, not a flux-surface average |
| `energy_due_to_recombination_at_ion_state` | `energy_due_to_recombination` | Process tokens are bare vocabulary entries — never append `_at_X` / `_in_X` / `_on_X` qualifiers |
| `energy_due_to_impurity_radiation_in_halo_region` | `radiated_energy_over_halo_region_due_to_impurity_radiation` | A region is a postfix `_over_` locus before the process suffix |
| `vertical_coordinate_of_outline_point` | owner-qualified vertical outline, or vocab gap | Omit the ordinal vertex label, retain the owning object and axis, and never merge outlines belonging to different objects |
| `x_ray_crystal_spectrometer_pixel_photon_energy_lower_bound` | `lower_bound_photon_energy` | **Instrument-prefix carry-over** — drop the instrument when the leaf is a generic physics observable. Keep as `_of_<instrument>` ONLY when the quantity is intrinsic to the hardware (e.g. `poloidal_plane_cross_sectional_area_of_rogowski_coil`) |
| `x1_coordinate_of_neutron_detector_geometry_outline` | `first_local_tangential_coordinate_of_neutron_detector` | **Local tangent axes are DISTINCT semantic directions, not storage labels** — map source-local X1/X2 to the REGISTERED carriers `first_local_tangential_coordinate` / `second_local_tangential_coordinate` (`base_kind=geometry`), retain the intrinsic owning object, and never emit `x1_coordinate` / `x2_coordinate` |
| `vertical_front_surface_radius_of_optical_element` for reflector X2 curvature | `second_local_tangential_radius_of_reflector` | X2 is an object-local surface tangent, not machine vertical. Keep `reflector`, drop the redundant `front_surface` wording, omit diagnostic/channel provenance, and do not claim a principal-curvature direction without source evidence |
| `radial_wave_electric_field` for `e_field/normal` | `flux_surface_normal_wave_electric_field` | The DD parent explicitly defines a projection normal to the magnetic flux surface. `radial` is reserved for cylindrical $R$; `perpendicular` would incorrectly imply the magnetic-field-relative plane |
| `halo_region_parallel_energy_due_to_heat_flux` | `parallel_halo_energy` | **Suffix-form for component** — component / transformation / reducer tokens come BEFORE the base as a leading qualifier prefix. Compare ★0.95 `parallel_fast_electron_pressure` |
| `z_coordinate_of_sensor_direction_unit_vector` | `z_direction_unit_vector_of_camera` | **Compound hardware identifiers** — a component of a device's orientation/direction unit vector is a locus-qualified coordinate. Drop stacked intermediate hardware tokens but KEEP the owning device as the `_of_<device>` locus. A device direction unit vector is a machine-frame Cartesian vector (triple `x`, `y`, `z`), so a `z` leaf is the `z` axis. `vertical` is the cylindrical Z (`radial`, `toroidal`, `vertical`) — never mix frames. Locus-less `z_direction_unit_vector` collapses every device's orientation to one name |
| both `camera/direction/z` and `camera/up/z` → `z_direction_unit_vector` | distinct bases per vector | **Distinct vectors of one device get DISTINCT bases** — `direction` is the line-of-sight, `up` is the image-up vector: different physical vectors. Never name a non-pointing vector (image-up, ellipse axis) bare `direction`; name what the vector IS |

> **UNIT-VECTOR LOCUS IS MANDATORY — this OVERRIDES any semantic-cluster suggestion.** A `*_unit_vector` base (direction, image-up, minor/major axis, …) ALWAYS requires a per-device locus `_of_<device>` when the source states the owning device. The public parser accepts a locus-less unit-vector name such as `z_direction_unit_vector`, but it is **semantically rejected for an owned device vector** because it erases the owner and collapses every device's orientation onto one name. If a cross-IDS semantic cluster groups this leaf with other devices (EC launcher mirror, camera, sensor, SPI shatter cone, …) and its description suggests "one generic name across device types without a device-specific locus", **IGNORE that suggestion for unit vectors** — emit the name for THIS source's own device using its `DEV:`/path device as the `_of_<device>` locus (`x_direction_unit_vector_of_electron_cyclotron_launcher_mirror`, `x_direction_unit_vector_of_camera`, `x_direction_unit_vector_of_sensor`, `x_direction_unit_vector_of_shatter_cone`). Each device gets its OWN distinct name. Only a displacement/position vector carrying a length unit (`m`) is NOT a unit vector — name it with the appropriate coordinate/position base, still per-device. |

## Hardware & Diagnostic Geometry — Specificity Required

Many DD paths describe hardware geometry (coil cross-sections, detector outlines,
aperture positions). These CAN yield valid standard names, but ONLY when the name
is **tokamak-universal** — meaningful across different fusion devices.

**The rule:** geometry names must include enough context to identify WHAT hardware
component is being described. Generic geometric primitives alone are useless.

| ❌ Too generic (SKIP these) | ✅ Specific enough | Why |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-----|
| `radius_of_annulus` | `inner_radius_of_poloidal_field_coil` | Names the owning coil with registered zone/base/locus segments |
| `alpha_of_oblique` | `angle_of_poloidal_field_coil` | Names the engineering owner without inventing a primitive token |
| `radius_of_circle` | SKIP — no tokamak-universal meaning | Pure geometric primitive |
| `height_of_rectangle` | `height_of_poloidal_field_coil` | Rectangle alone is meaningless; the owning coil is registered |
| `<owner>/outline/r` | owner-qualified radial outline, or vocab gap | Omit the vertex ordinal but retain the physical owner; never attach another object's outline to a generic or unrelated outline identity |
| `line_of_sight/first_point/r` | `radial_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` | **Enumeration is a coordinate, not a name** only within the same carrier: omit the endpoint ordinal, retain the explicit `line_of_sight` representation, and list only genuine sight-line endpoints in `dd_paths` |
| `coil/geometry/thick_line/first_point/r` | registered coil thick-line coordinate, or vocab gap | A thick-line conductor is not a line of sight; retain carrier, representation, owner, and axis or fail closed |

**When to SKIP geometry paths entirely:**

- The DD path describes a generic geometric primitive with no physics or engineering context
  (e.g., `*/geometry/arcs_of_circle/radius` — "radius of arc of circle" is a math concept, not a tokamak quantity)
- The quantity is purely local to one specific machine design and has no cross-device meaning
- The path describes coordinate bookkeeping (index arrays, grid connectivity)

**When to NAME geometry paths:**

- The quantity describes a recognizable hardware component that exists across tokamaks
  (coil centroids, detector positions, antenna dimensions, wall coordinates)
- The name includes the hardware context: `_of_poloidal_field_coil`, `_of_detector_aperture`,
  `_of_antenna_strap`, `_of_first_wall`
- Multiple tokamaks would use the same term for the same concept

### Positional samples never enter Standard Name identity — HARD

Never emit, propose, approve, or refine a Standard Name that encodes an ordered
sample or endpoint. Positional words such as **first, second, third, start, end**
and equivalent sample-position labels remain in the DD path and source
description as provenance, never in the identity. Apply this rule only when the
source structure proves that the word indexes a point or sample; do not strip a
registered semantic token such as `first_wall`, or `start`/`end` when it names a
state or process rather than sample position.

Dropping the positional label must preserve the exact quantity, owner, carrier,
geometry representation, axis, mechanism, and locus. If the same non-ordinal
identity needs an unavailable carrier or locus token, emit a `vocab_gap` for
that exact token. Never borrow `line_of_sight` or another object's identity.
Thus `radial_coordinate_of_arc_of_circle_start_point` is forbidden; the
intended semantic class is the radial coordinate of the same arc-of-circle
carrier without its endpoint index. If that carrier has no registered token,
emit the `vocab_gap` rather than inventing a Standard Name.

### Enumerated geometry points collapse to ONE name

**Enumeration is a coordinate, not a name** only when the ordinal is array
bookkeeping within the same physical geometry carrier and owner. Omit
`first_point` / `second_point` / `third_point`, but preserve the grandparent
carrier, its representation, its owner, and the axis projection. Emit
`dd_paths` covering only semantically equivalent ordinal siblings:

| DD leaves (ordinal siblings) | ✅ ONE name | Segments |
|---|---|---|
| `.../line_of_sight/first_point/r` + `.../second_point/r` + `.../third_point/r` | `radial_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` | `base_token=coordinate`, `base_kind=geometry`, `projection_axis=radial`, `locus_token=line_of_sight`, `locus_relation=of`, `locus_type=geometry` |
| `.../line_of_sight/*_point/z` | `vertical_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` | …`projection_axis=vertical` |
| `.../line_of_sight/*_point/phi` | `toroidal_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` | …`projection_axis=toroidal` |
| `<entity>/outline/r` (vertex array) | owner-qualified radial outline, or `vocab_gap` | retain `<entity>`; never use another object's outline identity |
| `<entity>/outline/z` (vertex array) | owner-qualified vertical outline, or `vocab_gap` | retain `<entity>`; never use another object's outline identity |

Use a registered owner-qualified form such as `radial_outline_of_wall` or
`radial_outline_of_plasma_boundary` when it matches the exact source owner.
Never teach bare `radial_outline` / `vertical_outline` as identities shared by
different objects. Ordinal siblings of one wall outline may consolidate, but a
wall outline and a plasma-boundary outline may not.

### Equal axis leaves never license shared attachments

An equal coordinate leaf or projection axis does not make different parent
properties equivalent. Apply these contrasts before proposing or reusing an
attachment:

- `boundary/geometric_axis/z` may produce only
  `vertical_coordinate_of_geometric_axis`, while
  `boundary/dr_dz_zero_point/z` must use an exact registered identity for the
  `dr/dz = 0` landmark or emit `vocab_gap`; never attach the landmark to the
  geometric-axis coordinate.
- `ece/channel/position/z` may produce only
  `vertical_coordinate_of_measurement_position`, while
  `ece/channel/delta_position_suprathermal/z` must retain its `delta` and
  `suprathermal` semantics through an exact registered carrier or emit
  `vocab_gap`; never attach the delta as the absolute measurement position.
- `boundary/outline/z` may produce
  `vertical_outline_of_plasma_boundary`: this is the positive
  property-specific control, and it does not license any other `z` leaf to
  share that attachment.

### Distinct carriers keep distinct names — HARD

A generic measurement-position identity is too vague to be a Standard Name.
`vertical_coordinate_of_measurement_position` currently carries 24 bound
sources spanning Thomson scattering, interferometers, Langmuir probes, NBI
beamlets, ion cyclotron antennas, barometry, reflectometers, visible
spectrometers, and ECE. That count is evidence that carrier semantics were
erased, not that the sources are equivalent. Each distinct carrier keeps its
own name qualified by that carrier, using an exact registered identity or a
`vocab_gap` when the required carrier token is unavailable.

Apply this rule concretely: a Thomson-scattering measurement position and an
interferometer measurement position require distinct carrier-qualified names;
an NBI beamlet position and an ion cyclotron antenna position also require
distinct names. Likewise, a delta or displacement never binds to an absolute
position identity. In particular, `ece/channel/delta_position_suprathermal/z`
must not attach to `vertical_coordinate_of_measurement_position`, even when an
ECE channel position already uses that identity.

`dd_paths` for `radial_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` MUST list every
`.../*_point/r` endpoint — the collapse is realised by attaching every endpoint
path to the single name. Do not include endpoints belonging to any other
geometry carrier.

**Non-line-of-sight counterexamples are hard exclusions.** `thick_line`
conductor geometry, pellet paths, gas pipes, shunt positions, beam paths,
interpolation knots, and outlines of other objects must never be recast as
`*_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` or as a generic unrelated outline. Preserve
their supported carrier/owner or emit a `vocab_gap`; an other-object outline
is never a consistency match.

**Distinguish points only by physical ENTITY, never by ordinal.** A point earns
a distinct name ONLY when it is a distinct physical entity (an aperture vs a
wall) — name it by that entity:

| Entity-distinguished point | Segments |
|---|---|
| `radial_position_of_aperture` | `base_token=position`, `base_kind=geometry`, `projection_axis=radial`, `locus_token=aperture`, `locus_relation=of`, `locus_type=entity` |
| `radial_position_of_first_wall` | …`locus_token=first_wall`, `locus_relation=of`, `locus_type=position` |

Never name such a point by its ordinal (no `first_point`/`second_point` in the name).

**Object-local X1/X2 axes are tangent directions, not ordinal points or machine
axes.** Map them to the REGISTERED semantic carriers
`first_local_tangential_coordinate` / `second_local_tangential_coordinate`
(`base_kind=geometry`) and keep each direction as its OWN name. Retain the
intrinsic owning object where it changes the quantity. Do NOT emit
`x1_coordinate` / `x2_coordinate`, call X2 `vertical`, or infer a principal
curvature direction from an opaque local-axis label.

## Non-Nameable Paths — route to `skipped` (do NOT compose)

Some DD paths are **coordinate or infrastructure bookkeeping**, not physics
observables. Composing a bare name for one of these fails the semantic gate and
then burns every refine rotation to exhaustion. Add the `source_id` to the
`skipped` list instead of emitting a candidate.

| ❌ Do NOT compose | DD path example | Why it is non-nameable |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `time` | `real_time_data/topic/time_stamp` | Time is the independent coordinate of a signal, not a named quantity |
| `initial_time_of_simulation` | `summary/simulation/time_begin` | Simulation start/stop timestamps are run metadata |
| `delay` | `bremsstrahlung_visible/latency` | Signal-chain latency is data-pipeline infrastructure, not plasma physics |
| `acquisition_period`, `dead_time` | diagnostic timing fields | Acquisition timing describes the instrument chain |
| `channel_index`, `element_count` | `*/index`, `*/count` | Counters and ordinals are array bookkeeping |
| version / comment / status strings | metadata leaves | Pure metadata, not a measurable quantity |

**Rule of thumb:** unit `s` + a description naming a timestamp / latency /
acquisition interval → `skipped`. A genuine physics time constant (confinement
time, decay time) is the rare nameable exception.

## Segment Routing — Common Confusions

The following tokens are frequently misrouted to the wrong grammar segment.
Study this table before composing — it eliminates the most common vocab-gap rejections.

| Token/Concept | ❌ Wrong Segment | ✅ Correct Segment | Correct Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `langmuir_probe`, `bolometer`, `interferometer` | position | device or object | Use as `_of_<device>` suffix |
| `r`, `major_radius_direction` | component | — | Use `radial` (closed component vocab) |
| `perpendicular`, `vertical`, `poloidal` | physical_base | component | These are direction tokens — use component segment |
| `unit_vector_*_component` | geometric_base | — | Decompose: component=`x`/`y`/`z` + geometric_base=`unit_vector` |
| `perturbed_*_field`, `electrostatic_potential` | process | physical_base | These are quantities, not mechanisms |
| `<registered_locus>_average` (an averaged path at a registered locus) | position + **transformation** | — | Preserve the exact registered locus supported by the DD. Apply `flux_surface_averaged` IFF the base is NOT constant on a flux surface: surface-varying bases require the operator so the average does not collide with the local value; a base marked `constant_on_flux_surface` in the injected grammar rejects the no-op operator and shares one name across local and averaged sources. |
| a bare registered locus in a local-value path | position | — | Preserve that exact registered locus and use no averaging transformation. Registered loci are distinct concepts; never collapse one into another unless the injected grammar explicitly publishes an advisory alias. |
| generic `measurement_position` | position (as token) | exact carrier or locus | A generic path leaf never licenses a generic Standard Name; use the enriched description to retain the specific carrier, or emit a vocabulary gap |
| `derivative_with_respect_to_*` | operators | transformation | Use transformation segment for derivatives |
| `diffusion_coefficient`, `convection_velocity` | process | physical_base | Transport coefficients are quantities, not processes |
| `parallel_viscosity`, `heat_viscosity` | process | physical_base | Viscosity is a quantity — process would be `viscous_diffusion` |

### Registered token slot ownership — HARD

Establish which grammar segment owns a token before declaring a vocabulary
gap. A token registered as a `geometric_base` MUST be emitted as
`base_token` with `base_kind: "geometry"`; never emit it as a
`physical_base` or report it missing from `physical_base`.

The worked example is `displacement`. The paths
`mhd_linear/time_slice/toroidal_mode/plasma/displacement_parallel/imaginary`,
`mhd_linear/time_slice/toroidal_mode/plasma/displacement_perpendicular/real`,
and
`mhd_linear/time_slice/toroidal_mode/plasma/displacement_perpendicular/imaginary`
all failed with the self-diagnosing error `non-actionable vocabulary gap:
displacement is a registered geometric_base token, not a physical_base - place
it in the geometric_base slot`. This is NOT a vocabulary gap and needs no
upstream release: use `displacement` in the `geometric_base` slot, then preserve
the source-stated parallel/perpendicular and real/imaginary distinctions in
their owning segments.

### Process vs Physical_base Decision Rule

The `process` segment is for mechanisms that MODIFY a quantity — they appear via `_due_to_<process>`.

- **Process (via `due_to_`):** use the full registered mechanism noun, such as `conduction`, `convection`, `diffusion`, `neoclassical_transport`, `turbulent_transport`, `ohmic_heating`, `impurity_radiation`, or `recombination`
- **Physical_base (the quantity itself):** temperature, pressure, flux, field, potential, coefficient, viscosity, diffusivity

**Test:** Can you say "X due_to Y"? If Y is a mechanism causing X, then Y is a process.
If Y is itself measurable, it's a physical_base.

### Loci come from the injected registry — a locus is not a zone

The registered locus tokens, the relations each allows (`_at_`/`_of_`/`_over_`/
along), and any finer VARIANTS of one feature are defined by the injected
grammar vocabulary — do not invent locus tokens or enumerate them from memory.
When the registry offers more than one locus for the same feature — a locus for
a field's *value* there vs one for its steepest-gradient point or the
coordinate/flux that *locates* it, or a sampled point vs a distribution/peak
over a surface vs a distinct contact/tangency point — pick the variant matching
what the source measures, using the relation that variant allows. Never fold a
locus into a zone prefix or force a bare feature token where the registry
defines a more specific locus.

✅ `energy_due_to_recombination` — recombination is a mechanism → process
✅ `current_density_due_to_ohmic_current_drive` — ohmic current drive is a mechanism → process
❌ `energy_due_to_diffusion_coefficient` — a coefficient is not a mechanism
❌ `temperature_due_to_magnetic_field` — magnetic field is a quantity, not a mechanism

## Description Quality Rules

- **No storage-shape tags** — NEVER write "1D", "2D", "3D", "scalar", "array",
  "profile", "time-dependent" in descriptions. The description defines the
  *physics*, not the data layout. Say "radial distribution of electron temperature"
  NOT "1D profile of electron temperature".
- **American English only** — use "center" not "centre", "meter" not "metre",
  "ionized" not "ionised", "behavior" not "behaviour", "polarization" not
  "polarisation". ISN catalog follows American spelling exclusively.
- **Physics-first framing** — describe what the quantity IS physically, not what
  the DD path stores or how it is measured.

## Batch Consistency Check

Before finalizing your output, verify:
1. **No synonymous names** — if you used `magnetic_flux` in one entry, don't use just `flux` in another
2. **Registry fidelity** — every locus uses the exact registered token and an allowed relation; distinct registered loci are never collapsed
3. **No DD leakage** — none of your names start with an IDS or DD section name
4. **No storage-shape tags** — none of your descriptions mention "1D", "2D", "3D", "profile", "array"
5. **American spelling** — check for "centre", "metre", "behaviour" and correct to American

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## DD Paths to Name

A generic DD leaf or path is only provenance; it never licenses a generic
Standard Name. Ground the identity first in the enriched source description —
which usually states the missing carrier, surface, subject, or process — then
use the unit, terse DD clause, and ancestor context as constraints. If that
complete identity cannot be expressed by the registered grammar, emit a
`vocab_gap` instead of dropping the distinguishing meaning.

  - **Sibling components:** {% for sib in item.family_siblings %}`{{ sib }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

  - **ISN naming convention:** Each component should be named `{axis}_{parent}` where `{parent}` is the shared vector name (e.g., `toroidal_current_density`). The `_component_of_` connector is REJECTED by the grammar — use the short leading-qualifier form.
  - All siblings MUST share the same `physical_base`, the same locus, and the same physics_domain — only the `component` (axis) segment differs.
  - **A machine-frame vector uses exactly ONE frame's triple:** Cartesian is `x`, `y`, `z`; cylindrical is `radial`, `toroidal`, `vertical`. A `z` leaf of a Cartesian vector (e.g. a device direction unit vector) is the `z` axis; a `z` leaf of a cylindrical vector is `vertical`. Never mix `z` with `radial`/`toroidal`, nor `vertical` into an `x`, `y`, `z` triple.
  - **Device orientation / direction unit-vector components KEEP the owning-object locus** (`_of_<device>`). ✓ `z_direction_unit_vector_of_camera`; ✗ locus-less `z_direction_unit_vector` (collapses every device's orientation to one name). Use the registered device token as the locus, and make sure the locus matches the DD path's device.
  - **Distinct vectors of one device get DISTINCT base carriers.** A device node may expose several vectors (`camera/direction` = line-of-sight, `camera/up` = image-up). Never fold a non-pointing vector into `direction_unit_vector` — name what the vector IS.
{% elif item.family_type == "geometric_coordinate" %}  - This path is the **{{ item.family_axis }}** coordinate of a geometric position.

{% if item.family_parent_name %}  - **Geometric base:** `{{ item.family_parent_name }}`{% endif %}

  - **ISN naming convention:** Geometric coordinates use `{axis}_{geometric_base}` form (e.g., `radial_position`, `vertical_position`, `toroidal_angle`). Do NOT use `component_of` or `coordinate_of` connectors for coordinates.
  - **Enumeration is a coordinate, not a name only within one carrier.** Omit an ordinal point index while preserving the exact grandparent geometry carrier, representation, owner, and axis. Only genuine `line_of_sight/*_point` paths may use `radial_coordinate_of_line_of_sight` / `vertical_coordinate_of_line_of_sight`; `thick_line`, pellet, pipe, shunt, beam-path, interpolation, and other-object outline paths retain their own identity or emit a `vocab_gap`. Never put `first_point`/`second_point`/`outline_point` in the name, and never replace that ordinal by an unrelated carrier.
  - **Object-local X1/X2 axes are DISTINCT tangent directions, not storage-shaped name tokens** — use `first_local_tangential_coordinate` / `second_local_tangential_coordinate`, retain the intrinsic owning object, and never emit `x1_coordinate` / `x2_coordinate` or reinterpret X2 as machine `vertical`.
  - Note: these siblings may have DIFFERENT units (e.g., metres vs radians) — this is expected for geometric coordinates.
{% elif item.family_type == "derivative" %}  - This path is a **derivative** quantity.
  - **Sibling derivatives:** {% for sib in item.family_siblings %}`{{ sib }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

  - **ISN naming convention:** a derivative is an OPERATOR applied to the numerator quantity X — never a coined compound base. Common cases use a dedicated item in `operators` with `base_token`=X: time derivative → `{"token":"time_derivative"}`; radial derivative → `{"token":"radial_derivative"}`; spatial gradient → `{"token":"gradient"}`. For a derivative with respect to a flux coordinate Y, use `{"token":"derivative_with_respect_to","coordinate":"<registered coordinate carrier>"}`. If no operator expresses it, emit a `vocab_gap` (segment `operator`) — do NOT coin `derivative_of_X_with_respect_to_Y` as a `base_token`.
  - All siblings sharing the same denominator should use the consistent operator + base form.
{% endif %}{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Description — MANDATORY

For **every** candidate, include a `description` field: a single-line
plain-English summary of the physical quantity (≤120 characters). This
description is used for embedding, search, and human review. Derive it from the
enriched source description; the terse DD documentation is supporting evidence,
not a replacement for the richer physical meaning. Examples:

- `"Electron temperature measured in the plasma core"`
- `"Toroidal component of the magnetic field"`
- `"Safety factor at the 95% poloidal flux surface"`

Do NOT repeat the standard name verbatim — add context that helps a reader
understand what the quantity represents physically.

## IR Segment Fields — MANDATORY

**You do NOT output a `standard_name` string.** You fill individual IR segment
fields. Code assembles the canonical name via ISN's `compose()` function.

For **every** candidate you emit, populate the IR segment fields inside a `segments` object.
This is not optional — it is how downstream tooling assembles and validates the name.

**Required fields inside `segments`:**
- `base_token`: the irreducible base quantity from the registry (e.g., `"temperature"`, `"magnetic_field"`)
- `base_kind`: `"quantity"` or `"geometry"`

**Optional segment fields** (omit or set null when not applicable):
- `projection_axis`: for vector/coordinate projections; `base_kind` derives the shape
- `qualifiers`: list of species/population/modifier tokens
- `locus_token` + `locus_relation` + `locus_type`: for postfix locus
- `process_token`: for `_due_to_` mechanism
- `operators`: ordered outer-to-inner mathematical operator applications

**Examples:**

- `electron_temperature` →
  `segments: {base_token: "temperature", base_kind: "quantity", qualifiers: ["electron"]}`
- `radial_magnetic_field` →
  `segments: {base_token: "magnetic_field", base_kind: "quantity", projection_axis: "radial"}`
- `minor_radius_of_plasma_boundary` →
  `segments: {base_token: "radius", base_kind: "geometry", qualifiers: ["minor"], locus_token: "plasma_boundary", locus_relation: "of", locus_type: "geometry"}`
- `time_derivative_of_electron_density` →
  `segments: {base_token: "density", base_kind: "quantity", qualifiers: ["electron"], operators: [{token: "time_derivative"}]}`

If you cannot decompose into valid IR segments, the concept is wrong — revise
rather than emit empty segments.

## Vocabulary Gaps

If a path requires a token that does **not** exist in a closed grammar segment
(e.g., a new `subject` species, a new `position`), do NOT invent an invalid name.
Instead, add the path to the `vocab_gaps` list in your response with:
- `source_id`: the DD path
- `segment`: which grammar segment is missing a token
- `token`: the token value you would need
- `reason`: why this token is needed

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Most vocab gaps are false positives.** Before emitting:
1. Search the token in ALL segment registries — it may exist in another segment
2. For compound tokens, check if each part exists as a registered token — decompose instead
3. Verify no existing token already covers the concept

**But a genuine missing base IS a real gap — emit it, do not guess.** When the
irreducible quantity has no registered `physical_base`/`geometric_base`, emit a
`vocab_gap` for that segment rather than substituting a near-synonym base or
fusing the concept into another token:
- A device **angle** (shatter angle, beam tilt angle) when no angle base is
  registered → `vocab_gap` (`segment: geometric_base`); never invent `tilt`.
- A **phase shift** of a probing wave (`refractometer/.../phase`) when
  `phase`/`phase_shift` is unregistered → `vocab_gap`, not a bare `wave_phase`.
- A **mode/perturbation phase** with an unregistered qualifier/base →
  `vocab_gap`, not a guessed compound.
- A characteristic **length/extent** when no length base is registered → reuse
  an accepted sibling (e.g. `extent_of_pellet`) via `attachments`, else
  `vocab_gap`.

A clean compose-time `vocab_gap` is cheap; a guessed near-base churns through
review and every refine rotation to exhaustion.
