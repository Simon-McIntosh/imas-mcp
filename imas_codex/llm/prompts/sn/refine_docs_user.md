You are refining the documentation for an existing standard name. A reviewer
scored a previous documentation attempt below the acceptance threshold. Study
the revision history below and produce improved documentation that materially
addresses the reviewer's concerns.

---

## Standard name being documented

- **Name:** `{{ sn_name }}`
- **Unit:** {{ unit or "—" }}
- **Kind:** {{ kind or "scalar" }}
- **Physics domain:** {{ physics_domain or "—" }}
{% if description and "description pending LLM enrichment" not in description %}
- **One-line description:** {{ description }}
{% endif %}

### Linked DD paths
{% if dd_paths %}
{% for path in dd_paths %}
- `{{ path.path }}`{% if path.ids %} ({{ path.ids }}{% if path.unit %}, unit: {{ path.unit }}{% endif %}){% elif path.unit %} (unit: {{ path.unit }}){% endif %}: {{ path.description or path.documentation or "(no documentation)" }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
_(no linked DD paths)_
{% endif %}

{% if locus_context and locus_context.defining_quantity %}
### Locus of this quantity

This entry's locus is **`{{ locus_context.token }}`**; its position is itself
defined by the standard quantity **`{{ locus_context.defining_quantity }}`**.
Cross-link it inline as `[label](name:{{ locus_context.defining_quantity }})`
at the first natural mention of the locus.{% if locus_context.description %} Locus gloss (for accurate prose — do NOT quote verbatim): {{ locus_context.description }}{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if derived_children %}
### THIS IS A DERIVED PARENT — generalize over its children when you rewrite

`{{ sn_name }}` is a structural **parent**: an abstraction over the more
specific child names below (its concrete physics + only DD grounding):

{% for c in derived_children %}- `{{ c.name }}`{% if c.unit %} [{{ c.unit }}]{% endif %}{% if c.physics_domain %} ({{ c.physics_domain }}){% endif %}{% if c.description %} — {{ c.description }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

The reviewer feedback below most likely flags **over-specialization** — docs
that re-describe a single child instead of the general quantity. Your rewrite
**must describe the general quantity these children share** and must **NOT**
narrow to any one child's species, component, axis, projection, qualifier, or
normalization (e.g. for parent `pressure_at_post_sawtooth_crash` write the
generic pressure at that state, not its `electron_pressure_*` child). Cross-
reference a representative child or two with `[label](name:bare_id)`. Ground
strictly on what the children attest.
{% endif %}

{% if sibling_family %}
### Sibling family — converge on the family template (shared parent `{{ sibling_family.parent.name }}`)

`{{ sn_name }}` is one member of a matched sibling set. Your rewrite must be
**structurally parallel** to the family: same opening noun-phrase template and
section structure as the anchor / accepted siblings, varying ONLY the
axis/species/zone-specific token, member-specific symbols, and genuinely
member-specific physics. Never copy a sibling's physics claim that does not
hold for this member — harmonize the structure, not the physics.

{% if sibling_family.anchor %}Template anchor **`{{ sibling_family.anchor.name }}`**{% if sibling_family.anchor.is_parent %} (the family parent){% endif %}:
- Anchor description: {{ sibling_family.anchor.description }}
{% if sibling_family.anchor.documentation %}- Anchor documentation:

{{ sibling_family.anchor.documentation }}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
Members:
{% for s in sibling_family.siblings %}
- `{{ s.name }}`{% if s.axis %} (axis: {{ s.axis }}){% endif %}{% if s.docs_stage %} — docs {{ s.docs_stage }}{% endif %}{% if s.description %} — {{ s.description }}{% endif %}{% if s.documentation_opening %}
  - documentation opens: "{{ s.documentation_opening }}"{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Docs revision history (oldest first; docs chain length so far: {{ docs_chain_length }})

{% if docs_chain_history %}

### Revision {{ loop.index }} (model: {{ h.model }})

- **Reviewer score:** {{ "%.2f"|format(h.reviewer_score) }}
- **Per-dimension comments:**
{% if h.reviewer_comments_per_dim %}
{% for dim, comment in h.reviewer_comments_per_dim.items() %}
  - **{{ dim }}**: {{ comment }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
  _(no per-dimension comments recorded)_

**Prior documentation:**

{{ h.documentation or "(empty)" }}

{% if docs_hint and edit_reason %}
### Expert steering ({{ edit_origin or "human" }})

A domain expert has proposed this documentation direction: "{{ docs_hint }}"
— for this reason: {{ edit_reason }}

This proposal is subordinate to the grammar and composition rules above —
realize the intent within the rules; if the rules forbid the literal
proposal, compose the nearest rule-compliant documentation. Do not treat it
as pre-approved.

## Your task

Produce updated documentation for `{{ sn_name }}` that materially addresses
the **lowest-scoring dimensions** identified in the revision history above,
for the **same quantity** `{{ sn_name }}` already denotes. Change what the
objection reaches and carry the rest through unchanged.

Rules:
- `description`: 1–3 sentences, ≤ 500 chars, no LaTeX, **American English**
  ("center", "meter", "ionization"), **no storage-shape tags** ("1D", "2D", "3D",
  "profile", "array" — describe the physics, not data layout).
- `documentation`: strict normative text with LaTeX math notation where
  appropriate, defining symbols, scope/exclusions, essential relationships,
  and any necessary sign convention. Remove generic diagnostics, estimator
  recipes, simulation workflows, typical machine or experiment values, and
  padding. Mention measurement/computation only when constitutive of the
  quantity or necessary to distinguish it from another quantity.
  Do **not** regress on dimensions that already scored well.
  **American English** throughout.
- `links`: list of related standard names in `name:xxx` format.
  Only include genuine conceptual relationships.
- Sign conventions (if COCOS-dependent): use exactly
  `Sign convention: Positive when <condition>.` as a standalone paragraph
  (blank line before/after, plain text — no headings, no bold).
- **No units in prose, no exceptions (HARD).** The unit is structured metadata
  rendered in the unit panel — never restate it in prose, whether as `(in eV)`,
  `<value> <unit>`, a standalone ASCII/LaTeX unit expression (e.g.
  `$\mathrm{kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-2}}$`), a `where $T_e$ is in eV` equation-variable
  annotation, or a unit-conversion statement. Define every symbol by its
  **identity** — the quantity it denotes, preferring a `[label](name:id)` link.
  An equation whose symbols are each a named quantity is already dimensionally
  unambiguous, so no unit is needed. If the existing doc carries any unit in
  prose, strip it — that is a primary goal of the refinement.
- **One canonical opening per family (HARD).** When the context above places
  this entry in a sibling family, open BOTH `description` and `documentation`
  with the SAME noun-phrase template as the family anchor, substituting only the
  member-specific token(s) the context supplies (species, axis, locus). The
  short `description` is NOT exempt. Do not invent a per-member opening shape
  (a leading "Total…"/"Unweighted…"/"Charge-state-summed…" adjective) for what
  is one quantity kind. This applies to number-density families (a particle
  count per volume): a bare species defaults to the charge-state-summed reading;
  an explicitly charge-state-resolved member states its specific state.
- **Charge-state aggregation (HARD).** A species-level quantity aggregated over
  charge states MUST state the convention: extensive quantities (a per-volume
  amount) are charge-state-summed ("summed over all charge states"); intensive
  quantities (per-particle fields) are the density-weighted mean over charge
  states ("density-weighted mean over all charge states") — an intensive
  quantity is never "summed". Cross-link the charge-state-resolved counterpart
  when the provided names include one.
- **Compound / reaction-pair species.** When the injected subject/species
  semantics mark the subject as a compound fuel mixture or a fusion reaction
  pair, pick the reading the quantity denotes: the effective single fuel species
  (the isotope mixture as one species, with its mean atomic mass) for fuel state
  quantities, or the fusion reaction channel for reaction-product / reactivity
  quantities. Keep the underscore spelling in the name; prose may hyphenate.
- **Locus-defining cross-link.** When the quantity is evaluated at a locus whose
  position is itself a defined standard name, cross-link that position-defining
  quantity inline with `[label](name:bare_id)` — using the defining quantity the
  injected locus context supplies, only when it exists in the provided names.
  Do not hardcode or guess a locus→defining-quantity mapping.
- The `name` field must equal `{{ sn_name }}` exactly — do not alter it.

Return a JSON object matching the output schema with fields:
``description``, ``documentation``, ``links``.
