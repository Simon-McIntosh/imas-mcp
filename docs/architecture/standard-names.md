# Standard Name Generation Pipeline

> DD-enriched standard name generation: classify IMAS paths, batch by physics
> concept, compose names via LLM, review with an RD-quorum, refine low-scoring
> names and docs, and persist to the knowledge graph. Design rationale lives in

This is the detailed reference. `AGENTS.md` carries only the orientation
(pool table, command index, lifecycle axes, module map) and the safety
tripwires; everything below is the authoritative depth behind it.

## Overview

Standard names give each IMAS Data Dictionary path a canonical, human-readable
physics identity — e.g. `electron_temperature` for
`core_profiles/profiles_1d/electrons/temperature`. They bridge the structural
DD namespace and the semantic physics vocabulary, enabling cross-facility and
cross-IDS data discovery.

Names follow a **composable grammar** (from `imas_standard_names`, ISN) where a
name is built from ordered segments:

```
{subject}_{qualifier1}_{qualifier2}_{physical_base}_{due_to_process}
```

Examples: `electron_temperature`, `toroidal_magnetic_field_at_magnetic_axis`,
`ion_deuterium_density`. ISN owns the grammar, vocabulary, and validation;
codex owns the pipeline, evaluation, and graph persistence.

## Seven-Pool Run Loop

`sn run` drives a **single concurrent loop of seven pools**. Each pool claims
eligible work by a stage gate, does one unit of work, and persists a durable
state transition. Pools run concurrently, weighted by `POOL_WEIGHTS`
(`imas_codex/standard_names/pools.py`); the loop orchestrator is
`run_sn_pools()` in `loop.py`.

| Pool | Label | Stage gate | Key operation |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | `GENERATE_NAME` | `StandardNameSource.status=pending` | LLM generates a name; new SN persisted at `name_stage='drafted'`. **Unit injected from DD — never from LLM.** |
| 2 | `ENRICH_PARENTS` | `origin='derived' AND description=placeholder AND has live child` | LLM synthesizes a real description for a placeholder derived parent by **generalizing over its children**, embeds it locally, and **accepts it structurally** (`name_stage → 'accepted'`, score inherited from accepted children — skips REVIEW_NAME). Breaks the derived-parent coverage deadlock (see [Derived / Structural Parents](#derived--structural-parents)). Childless derived parents are legitimately unscoped and skipped. Model: `get_model("sn-parent-enrich")` (compose-tier). |
| 3 | `REVIEW_NAME` | `name_stage='drafted'` | RD-quorum scores the name; atomic transition → `accepted` (rsn≥min) / `reviewed` / `exhausted`. Also admits `origin='derived'` parents via the admissibility gate; inadmissible accepted parents are deleted by `normalize_derived_parent_lifecycle` at startup. |
| 4 | `REFINE_NAME` | `name_stage='reviewed' AND rsn<min AND chain_length<cap` | Creates a NEW SN node; predecessor flipped to `superseded`; source edges migrated; `REFINED_FROM` edge added. |
| 5 | `GENERATE_DOCS` | `name_stage='accepted' AND docs_stage='pending'` | LLM generates documentation; `docs_stage → 'drafted'`. Cross-pipeline gate: fires only after the name is accepted. |
| 6 | `REVIEW_DOCS` | `docs_stage='drafted'` | RD-quorum scores docs; atomic transition → `accepted` / `reviewed` / `exhausted`. **On promotion to `accepted`, the doc's bare `[name]` brackets are normalized at source** (`_normalize_bare_doc_links` scoped to the node) — link if the target is a live SN, else strip — so no accepted doc carries a broken bracket regardless of when it was written. |
| 7 | `REFINE_DOCS` | `docs_stage='reviewed' AND rds<min AND docs_chain_length<cap` | Rewrites docs in-place; prior content snapshotted on a `DocsRevision` node via `DOCS_REVISION_OF`; `docs_stage → 'drafted'`. |

`ENRICH_PARENTS` is a name-axis producer: it runs under `--names-only` and
`--flush` (it drains the *existing* placeholder backlog, not new work), is
excluded under `--docs-only`, and shares the single `--cost-limit` budget pool.
Its weight and replica count live alongside the other pools in `POOL_WEIGHTS`
and `[tool.imas-codex.sn-pools].enrich-parents-replicas`.

`--flush` has fixed membership: it excludes only `generate_name` and drains
`review_name`, `refine_name`, `generate_docs`, `review_docs`, `refine_docs`,
and `enrich_parents`. It does not auto-seed new source work.

**Acceptance always overrides cap.** Even at `chain_length == cap − 1`, a
passing score wins — there is no forced exhaustion on a good result.

**Escalation.** On the final refine attempt (`chain_length == cap − 1`) the pool
switches to `DEFAULT_ESCALATION_MODEL` (default
`openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`), overridable via `--escalation-model`.

**Backlog throttle.** When the refine_name backlog exceeds 0.5 × the
generate_name backlog, `BudgetManager.pool_admit` dampens the generate_name
effective weight by 0.5× so refinement can catch up.

**Orphan sweep.** A `refining` claim that stalls reverts to `reviewed` after
`DEFAULT_ORPHAN_SWEEP_TIMEOUT_S` (600 s). The periodic sweep lives in
`orphan_sweep.py`.

**Loop termination.** A live run succeeds only after the pending-count query
has freshly observed zero eligible work after the latest batch completion.
Pending-count read failures stop as `pending_count_failed`; a pending-positive
no-progress window stops as `stalled`. Budget exhaustion or saturation, the
wall-clock limit, provider exhaustion, degraded accounting, interruption, and
every other unproven closure exit nonzero. Each outcome is written to the
`SNRun.stop_reason`; `sn status` surfaces the most recent run.

### Scope routing

`sn run` runs the full loop across all eligible work by default. Two narrower
modes:

- `--only <phase>` — run a single phase in isolation (e.g. `--only reconcile`
  to mark stale sources without composing).
- `--focus <path>` — route specific DD paths through the full seven-pool loop,
  scoped by a UUID `scope_run_id`. Use for iterative prompt development and
  quality investigation on individual paths without a full rotation. Three
  input forms: trailing positional args (`sn run path1 path2`), quoted
  space-separated (`--focus "path1 path2"`), or repeated flags
  (`--focus path1 --focus path2`). Single-pass focus seeding is handled by
  `pool_adapter.run_explicit_paths()`.

## EXTRACT → COMPOSE Sub-Pipeline

Inside `GENERATE_NAME` (and via `pool_adapter.run_explicit_paths()` on the
single-pass focus path) runs the extract→compose→validate→consolidate→persist
sub-pipeline:

```
 ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐
 │  EXTRACT  │────▶│  COMPOSE  │────▶│ VALIDATE  │────▶│CONSOLIDATE│────▶│  PERSIST  │
 │ DD query  │     │ LLM call  │     │ ISN 3-    │     │ dedup     │     │ Neo4j     │
 │ classify  │     │ per-batch │     │ layer +   │     │ conflicts │     │ conflict  │
 │ enrich    │     │ unit from │     │ round-trip│     │ coverage  │     │ detection │
 │ group     │     │ DD only   │     │           │     │           │     │           │
 └───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘
```

### Classification (node_category)

SN-eligibility is **owned by the DD `node_category`** classification, not a
bespoke rule engine. EXTRACT pre-filters DD paths through
`SN_SOURCE_CATEGORIES` in `imas_codex/core/node_categories.py` — only physics
quantities and the categories declared there proceed to COMPOSE. Error fields,
pure metadata, structural nodes, and identifiers are filtered out by category.

### Enrichment (cluster selection + grouping)

`imas_codex/standard_names/enrichment.py`:

- **Primary cluster selection** — each path may belong to multiple semantic
  clusters; one primary is chosen by scope rank (IDS > domain > global), then
  highest `similarity_score`, then lexicographic tie-break.
- **Grouping cluster selection** — for batching context, the *broadest* scope
  is preferred (global > domain > IDS).
- **Global grouping by (cluster × unit)** — grouping is global across all IDSs,
  not per-IDS. If `electron_temperature` appears in `core_profiles`,
  `core_sources`, and `equilibrium`, all three land in the same batch so the
  LLM sees the full cross-IDS picture and assigns one name. Oversized groups
  split on `max_batch_size` (token-budget guard); unclustered paths sub-group
  by `parent_path`.

Each batch carries: cluster description, cross-IDS path summary, sibling paths,
and existing standard names for reuse.

### Validation (ISN 3-layer + grammar round-trip)

`_validate_via_isn()` runs three annotation-only layers:

1. **Pydantic** — `create_standard_name_entry()` fires its field validators.
2. **Semantic** — `run_semantic_checks()` runs grammar-semantic checks.
3. **Description** — `validate_description()` checks for metadata leakage.

Validation is **annotation-only**: entries are never rejected by semantic
warnings — they persist to `validation_issues` (tagged strings) and
`validation_layer_summary` (JSON per-layer counts). The only **hard
quarantine** triggers are: grammar round-trip failure
(`parse_standard_name()` rejects), Pydantic construction error, or detected
ambiguity (one name → multiple distinct physical quantities). See
[Validation Gating](#validation-gating).

### Consolidation (`consolidation.py`)

After VALIDATE, all candidates are consolidated in one pass.

**Dedup** — when batches produce the same name: keep the longest documentation,
**union** `imas_paths` and `tags`, keep the highest confidence.

**Conflict checks**, applied in order — conflicting entries are *filtered out*,
not failed (the pipeline makes partial progress rather than aborting):

| Check | Type | Catches |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | `unit_mismatch` | Same name proposed with different units |
| 2 | `kind_mismatch` | Same name with different kind (scalar vs vector) |
| 3 | `duplicate_source` | One source path claimed by multiple names |
| 4 | Coverage gap | Source paths with no candidate mapping |
| 5 | Registry reuse | Existing accepted names → reuse instead of mint |

## Unit Safety Model

Units flow from the Data Dictionary to the graph — **never from LLM output**.

```
DD (HAS_UNIT relationship)
  → EXTRACT reads unit from graph
  → COMPOSE prompt marks unit "read-only, authoritative" (LLM output has no unit field)
  → worker injects DD unit into the candidate dict
  → PERSIST writes (StandardName)-[:HAS_UNIT]->(Unit)
```

If the LLM emits a unit anyway, the worker discards it and uses the DD value.
`cocos`, `cocos_transformation_type`, `dd_version`, and `physics_domain` are
likewise DD-authoritative and injected post-LLM — `physics_domain` comes
directly from `IMASNode.physics_domain` (falls back to `"general"`).

## Scoring

Review scoring uses integer per-dimension scores (0–20) normalized to a 0–1
aggregate. The **rubric-driven numeric `score` (0–1) is the sole accept/refine
signal** — there is no separate `verdict` field; the reviewer LLM produces
scores plus optional `revised_name` / `suggested_name`.

**Name axis (4 dims):** grammar, semantic, convention, completeness.
**Docs axis (4 dims):** description_quality, documentation_quality,
completeness, physics_accuracy.
**Benchmark (6 dims):** grammar, semantic, documentation, convention,
completeness, compliance (aggregate `sum / 120.0`).

Criteria are defined in `imas_codex/llm/config/sn_review_criteria.yaml`.

**Tier thresholds** (`review_tier`, derived from `reviewer_score_name`):

| Tier | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| outstanding | ≥0.85 |
| good | ≥0.60 |
| inadequate | ≥0.40 |
| poor | <0.40 |

## RD-Quorum Review

`sn review` (and the `REVIEW_NAME` / `REVIEW_DOCS` pools) use a
**Rational-Disagreement quorum** for high-confidence axis scores. The two axes
(`names`, `docs`) are independent, each with its own rubric, model chain, and
per-axis score columns.

```
 cycle 0: primary   (BLIND)  ──┐
 cycle 1: secondary (BLIND)  ──┼─ disagree on any dim? → cycle 2
 cycle 2: escalator (SEES 0+1) ┘  (only if disputed items exist AND len(models)==3)
```

- **Cycle 0** (primary, blind) scores with `models[0]`.
- **Cycle 1** (secondary, blind) re-scores with `models[1]` — blindness
  enforced (no `prior_reviews` block in the prompt).
- An item is **disputed** if any per-dimension diff between cycles 0 and 1
  exceeds `disagreement-threshold` (default 0.15, normalized 0–1).
- **Cycle 2** (escalator, context-aware) runs only if disputed items exist AND
  `len(models) == 3`; it receives both prior critiques and is authoritative for
  the disputed items.

**Immediate persistence:** each cycle's `Review` nodes are written before the
next cycle starts (crash-safety). After all cycles,
`update_review_aggregates` picks the most-recent winning group and mirrors final
scores onto the SN axis slots.

**Partial-failure ladder:** both missing → retry → `retry_item` (quarantine);
one missing → `single_review`.

**`resolution_method` (on `Review` nodes):**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `quorum_consensus` | Cycles 0+1 agreed; final = mean |
| `authoritative_escalation` | Cycle 2 ran; authoritative for disputed items |
| `max_cycles_reached` | 0+1 disagreed, no escalator; mean + disagreement flag |
| `retry_item` | Both cycles failed; item quarantined |
| `single_review` | Only one cycle produced a score |

**1:1 scoring invariant:** each submitted name receives exactly one score per
cycle. Names are sent in batches; the response is matched back by ID; unmatched
names are auto-retried individually so none is silently dropped on LLM
truncation.

**Configuration:** `[tool.imas-codex.sn-review]` (`disagreement-threshold`,
`max-cycles`, `active-profile`) + `[tool.imas-codex.sn-review.{names,docs}]`
(`models = [cycle0, cycle1, cycle2]`). Named profiles live under
`[tool.imas-codex.sn-review.names.profiles.*]`. Accessors:
`get_sn_review_{names,docs}_models()`, `get_sn_review_max_cycles()`,
`get_sn_review_disagreement_threshold()`, `get_sn_review_active_profile()`.

```toml
[tool.imas-codex.sn-review.names]
models = [
  "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash",     # cycle 0 primary (blind, cheapest)
  "openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4",                 # cycle 1 secondary (blind, fast)
  "openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview",  # cycle 2 escalator (highest quality)
]
```

**Budget:** `review_pipeline` reserves `batch_cost × num_models × 1.3` upfront
via `BudgetLease.reserve()`, then charges per cycle — prevents secondary-cost
leaks on a mid-cycle crash.

**Axis-split review storage:** name and docs reviews persist to independent
column families so a docs pass cannot clobber name-only data and vice-versa.
Paired slots per axis: `reviewer_score_{axis}`, `reviewer_scores_{axis}`
(per-dim JSON), `reviewer_comments_{axis}`,
`reviewer_comments_per_dim_{axis}`, `reviewer_model_{axis}`. Same-axis
re-review requires `--force`; the guard is `_axis_overwrite_blocked` in
`review/pipeline.py`. **Review never demotes** — a low-scoring `valid` name
stays `valid` and routes to a refine pool.

**`Review` node fields (RD-quorum):** `review_axis`, `cycle_index` (0/1/2),
`review_group_id` (UUID per quorum session), `resolution_role`
(primary/secondary/escalator), `resolution_method`. `id` format:
`{sn_id}:{axis}:{review_group_id}:{cycle_index}`.

## Structured Fan-Out

`imas_codex/standard_names/fanout/` runs a bounded
Proposer → Executor → Synthesizer fan-out for `refine_name`. The Proposer emits
a closed-catalog `FanoutPlan` (Pydantic discriminated union on `fn_id`, all
bounds enforced at parse time); a pure-Python executor runs it in parallel via
`asyncio.to_thread`; the call-site's LLM call ingests the rendered evidence
block. No agentic loop, no runtime function generation.

- **Runtime gating lives in config** (`[tool.imas-codex.sn-fanout]`). Current
  rollout is enabled for `refine_name`; if disabled, `run_fanout()` is a true
  no-op.
- **One `GraphClient` per refine cycle** — the worker passes its `gc` in;
  runners never instantiate their own.
- **Cost ownership:** the Proposer call is charged to the caller's
  `BudgetLease` as a sub-event with `batch_id=fanout_run_id`; callers stamp the
  same id on the Synthesizer charge so the `Fanout` ↔ `LLMCost` graph join
  works.
- **`Fanout` node** is telemetry-only, runtime-written (like `LLMCost`); exempt
  from LinkML schema management.

## Derived / Structural Parents

Structural parent SNs are inferred from the ISN grammar peel and enter with
`origin='derived'`, `name_stage='pending'`. The placeholder node is created at
write time by `_write_standard_name_edges` **only if it passes the two-clause
admission gate** in `imas_codex/standard_names/parents.py`
(`is_admissible_parent_name`):

- **Clause A — IR specificity.** `parse_standard_name(name).ir` has at least one
  non-empty qualifier, operator, projection, locus, or mechanism. This admits
  `elongation_of_plasma_boundary` and rejects bare bases like `pressure`.
- **Clause B — vector-like topology.** The candidate already has ≥2 inbound
  `HAS_PARENT` edges with `operator_kind='projection'` and distinct `axis`
  values. This admits bare-base vectors like `magnetic_field` and
  `electric_field` on topological grounds. (Clause B is callable without a live
  graph via a stub `gc`.)

Names failing both clauses are never created; their children remain parentless
and group via shared `physical_base` / `qualifier` grammar fields in Cypher.

**Why bare-base scalars are excluded:** category labels like `pressure`,
`density`, `temperature` *are* the `physical_base` grammar segment — making
parent nodes for them would populate the catalog with trivially generic entries
carrying no scientific identity. Clause A rejects exactly these.

Once created, derived parents flow through the standard
`REVIEW_NAME → GENERATE_DOCS → REVIEW_DOCS` path. Derived parents are skipped from the refine loop (their names are structurally
fixed). Admissibility is enforced by `is_admissible_parent_name`, and
`normalize_derived_parent_lifecycle` deletes any inadmissible accepted derived
parent — with its `HAS_PARENT` edges and review scaffolding — on every `sn run`
startup; description-quality failures route to `REFINE_DOCS`. The
`apply_derived_parent_migration` idempotent self-healing
pass runs on every `sn run` startup to migrate legacy `origin='deterministic'`
entries. There is no separate `sn parents` CLI — all parent handling is folded
into `sn run`.

### Breaking the coverage deadlock — `ENRICH_PARENTS`

A freshly materialized derived parent carries the
`DETERMINISTIC_PARENT_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER` until a real description is
written. That placeholder is a **deadlock**: `claim_review_name_batch` excludes
it (review needs a real description for the semantic-similarity check), so it
never earns a `reviewer_score_name`; and `claim_generate_docs_batch` gates on
`reviewer_score_name IS NOT NULL`, so it never earns docs either. The parent is
parked at `name_stage='accepted'` (held) and is invisible to both axes.

The `ENRICH_PARENTS` pool breaks this loop. For each claimed placeholder parent
with ≥1 live child it:

1. fetches the parent's live `HAS_PARENT` children (the concrete instances) via
   `fetch_derived_parent_children`,
2. renders the `sn/enrich_parent_{system,user}` prompts — which ground strictly
   on the children's accepted descriptions + names, never invented physics —
   and calls `get_model("sn-parent-enrich")` (compose-tier; `generate_docs`
   rewrites the full long-form documentation downstream),
3. embeds the synthesized description locally (free), and
4. persists via `persist_enriched_parent`: writes `description` + `embedding`,
   stamps `parent_enriched_at` / `parent_enrich_model`, and **accepts the
   parent structurally** — `name_stage → 'accepted'` with `reviewer_score_name`
   inherited from its accepted children (the min — "as valid as its weakest
   accepted child"; falls back to `DEFAULT_MIN_SCORE`) and
   `reviewer_model_name='structural-inheritance'`.

**Why skip REVIEW_NAME.** A derived parent's name is a deterministic grammar
peel that already passed the admission gate, and its description generalizes
over already-RD-quorum-accepted children — so it inherits name validity by
construction. Routing it through the name quorum is not just wasteful (~$0.27
each) but actively harmful: the quorum systematically marks a parent down for
being *less specific than its children* — measured ~66% of derived parents
scored <0.85 (mean 0.778) despite clean grammar, and a structurally-fixed name
cannot be improved by refine_name, so each rejection becomes a futile
refine→exhaust that strands the parent with no docs. Description quality is
still fully gated on the docs axis (`GENERATE_DOCS` → `REVIEW_DOCS`). The
`reviewer_model_name='structural-inheritance'` marker keeps these acceptances
auditably distinct from real LLM reviews; any prior review is preserved in the
`StandardNameReview` history.

The physics domain was already inherited from the children at materialize time
(`_materialize_derived_parent_rows`), so enrichment leaves it untouched.
**Childless derived parents are legitimately unscoped — they are never claimed
and never fabricated.** The pool is **not throttled** (it no longer feeds the
review_name bottleneck; it is cheap, drains a finite backlog, and the accepted
parents queue durably in `generate_docs`-pending) and runs under `--flush`, so a
cost-capped `sn run --flush` cleanly drains the existing backlog.

**`MAGNITUDE_OF` edge:** when the pipeline composes a `magnitude_of_<X>` name
from a real DD/signal source AND `<X>` is an admitted `kind='vector'` parent,
`_emit_magnitude_of_edges` emits `(magnitude_sn)-[:MAGNITUDE_OF]->(vector_sn)`.
**Passive** — never created speculatively. This is an algebraic-sibling
relationship, not hierarchical like `HAS_PARENT`.

## Prompt Architecture

### Static-first ordering

Two-message pattern optimized for prompt caching:

1. **System message** (static, ~6k tokens) — grammar rules, canonical segment
   order, full vocabulary, curated examples, tokamak ranges, composition rules,
   output schema. Cached by OpenRouter across calls. Rendered from
   `sn/compose_system.md`.
2. **User message** (dynamic, per-batch) — unit policy, batch context (IDS,
   cluster, siblings), existing names for reuse, per-path detail. Rendered from
   `sn/compose_dd.md`.

In Jinja templates, `{% include %}` schema/rules blocks go *before* dynamic
variables to maximize the cacheable prefix. `build_compose_context()` in
`context.py` assembles the static context (module-level cache).

### Per-item DD context injection

Each DD path item is enriched with four channels during EXTRACT:

1. **Hybrid DD search neighbours** (`hybrid_neighbours`) — concept-similar DD
   paths via vector + keyword search (`_hybrid_search_neighbours` in
   `workers.py`, backed by `hybrid_dd_search` in `graph/dd_search.py`).
2. **Related DD paths** (`related_neighbours`) — cross-IDS structural siblings
   via explicit graph relationships (cluster membership, shared coordinates,
   matching units, identifier schemas, COCOS transformation type), via
   `find_related_dd_paths`.
3. **Error companions** (`error_fields`) — uncertainty fields (`_error_upper`,
   `_error_lower`, `_error_index`) for each path.
4. **Identifier enum values** (`identifier_values`) — allowed enumeration
   values (name, index, description) when a path references an identifier
   schema.

**Compose retry with expanded context:** on grammar/validation failure the
compose worker retries up to `retry_attempts` times (default 1), re-enriching
with expanded hybrid search (`search_k=retry_k_expansion`, default 12).
Configurable via `[tool.imas-codex.sn]` or `IMAS_CODEX_SN_RETRY_*` env vars.

**Scored-example injection:** compose and review prompts include dynamically
selected exemplar StandardName nodes at target thresholds `(1.0, 0.8, 0.65,
0.4)`, graph-backed and chosen at runtime by the example loader. Context keys:
`compose_scored_examples`, `review_scored_examples`.

### Shared prompt fragments

- `{% include "sn/_grammar_reference.md" %}` — grammar vocabulary + segment
  order (used in `compose_system.md`).
- `llm/prompts/shared/sn/_scoring_rubric.md` — shared scoring-rubric reference.
- `llm/config/sn_review_criteria.yaml` — dimensions and tiers (via
  `load_prompt_config()`).
- ISN context keys (`quick_start`, `common_patterns`, `critical_distinctions`)
  rendered in the compose prompt.
- Axis review prompts `review_names.md` / `review_docs.md` share a
  `{% if prior_reviews %}…{% endif %}` block rendered **only** for the cycle-2
  escalator — cycles 0 and 1 never see it (blindness enforced).

**Response model:** `StandardNameComposeBatch` (`candidates`, `skipped`,
`vocab_gaps`). `vocab_gaps` capture cases where the grammar lacks a needed
token; see [Grammar vocabulary](#grammar-vocabulary).

## Lifecycle

### Four StandardName axes

| Axis | States | Set by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name_stage` / `docs_stage` | `pending → drafted → reviewed → {accepted \| refining → drafted \| exhausted \| superseded}` | Pool workers | Cross-pipeline gate: `GENERATE_DOCS` fires only when `name_stage='accepted'`. `refining` reverts to `reviewed` after 600 s (orphan sweep). `chain_length` / `docs_chain_length` track refinement depth (root = 0). `superseded` = predecessor in a `REFINED_FROM` chain; source edges migrate to the latest. |
| `name_stage` | `pending → drafted → reviewed → accepted` (`refining`/`exhausted`/`superseded` side states) | `sn run` → `sn release --export-only` → `sn approve` | Name-pipeline + catalog round-trip state. |
| `status` | `draft → published → deprecated` | Catalog PR (`sn approve`) | ISN vocabulary lifecycle; pipeline defaults to `draft`. Deprecated names link via `superseded_by` ↔ `deprecates`. |
| `validation_status` | `pending → valid \| quarantined` | Compose worker | Gates `sn review`, consolidation, and `sn release --export-only`. Critical failures (grammar round-trip, Pydantic, ambiguity) quarantine; semantic warnings stay `valid`. |

**`origin`:** `pipeline` (LLM-generated), `catalog_edit` (human-edited via
catalog PR), or `derived` (structural parent from the admission gate).
`filter_protected()` skips `PROTECTED_FIELDS` on `catalog_edit` names unless
overridden via `sn run --override-edits <name>`. PR provenance:
`catalog_pr_number`, `catalog_pr_url`, `catalog_commit_sha`; round-trip
timestamps: `exported_at`, `imported_at`.

### StandardNameSource lifecycle

`StandardNameSource` nodes track individual DD-path / facility-signal
extraction. Written by the extract worker, updated by the compose worker:

```
extracted → composed | attached | vocab_gap | failed | stale
```

- **extracted** — queued for composition.
- **composed** — LLM generated a new name for this source.
- **attached** — auto-attached to an existing name (no LLM call).
- **vocab_gap** — a grammar vocabulary gap prevented naming.
- **failed** — composition failed (LLM error, validation rejection).
- **stale** — backing DD path / signal no longer exists (set by reconcile).

**ID format:** `dd:{full_dd_path}` or `signals:{facility}:{signal_id}` — the
`dd:` prefix is the canonical URI scheme (e.g.
`dd:equilibrium/time_slice/profiles_1d/psi`).

**Reconciliation:** `sn run --only reconcile` marks sources whose backing path
no longer exists as `stale`.

### Exact-source compose steering

`sn source-hint` attaches durable, non-authoritative composition steering to
one existing DD source before it enters pooled composition:

```
imas-codex sn source-hint <exact-dd-path> --hint TEXT --reason TEXT \
    [--replace] [--dry-run]
```

The path must identify one exact DD source; a leading `dd:` is optional and
wildcards, signal-source ids, and whitespace are refused. The source must be
`extracted`, unclaimed, below the composition-attempt cap, and free of a live
name binding. An existing open hint is also refused unless `--replace` is
explicit. `--dry-run` reports the same decision without writing. Eligibility
is checked again in the write query, so a concurrent claim or binding wins and
the hint write reports the resulting refusal instead of steering in-flight
work. This compare-and-set boundary is intentionally exact-source-only: the
command cannot fan out to siblings, families, path patterns, or facility
signals.

The source stores `compose_hint`, its separate `compose_hint_reason`, request
and consumption timestamps, and a `compose_hint_status` lifecycle:

- `open` — delivered with that exact source whenever a generate-name worker
  claims it;
- `consumed` — the source atomically bound a newly generated, reserved, or
  already-stable name;
- `rejected` — reserved in the schema for a future explicit retirement
  transition; no current CLI command sets this state.

Only a successful source-to-name binding consumes an open hint. Validation
failure, an LLM or persistence error, retry, interruption, claim expiry, and a
name collision leave the hint open for the next claim. The text is retained
after consumption as provenance; consumption changes the lifecycle fields
rather than erasing the request.

The pooled compose prompt receives an open hint and reason alongside the
source's pinned DD snapshot. Steering may help interpret the quantity, but it
cannot modify or override the DD version, unit, COCOS convention, physics
domain, source identity, grammar validation, or other DD-authoritative fields.
The reason is independent of `last_error` and retry-event reasons, so failure
reporting cannot overwrite operator intent.

Use this command only when a source has no live name to edit. It differs from
the adjacent recovery surfaces:

- `sn retry --failed ... --reason ...` releases a terminal or attempt-capped
  source and records why another attempt is allowed; its reason is audit data,
  not prompt steering.
- `sn retry --skipped <exact-path> ... --reason ...` releases only the named
  skipped sources. It refuses claimed sources and any source with a live name
  binding, expands no patterns or families, and supports `--dry-run` for exact
  eligibility counts. The compare-and-set transaction writes a
  `StandardNameSourceRetry` before returning the source to `extracted`;
  `previous_status='skipped'` is the schema-defined recovery-kind signal. The
  source identity, DD edge, and any open compose hint remain unchanged.
- `sn run --retry-skipped` is selection-only. It does not make skipped sources
  claimable or mutate their lifecycle; use the exact recovery command above.
- `sn edit <name> --hint ... --reason ...` steers an existing StandardName and
  can apply a name/family/subtree scope; `sn source-hint` instead steers the
  next successful binding of exactly one DD source.

The safe operator sequence is to preview and set the hint, then run the normal
pool loop with that same exact path, for example:

```
imas-codex sn source-hint equilibrium/time_slice/.../quantity \
    --hint "Preserve the source-defined denominator." \
    --reason "The DD description defines a ratio against the complementary set." \
    --dry-run
imas-codex sn source-hint equilibrium/time_slice/.../quantity \
    --hint "Preserve the source-defined denominator." \
    --reason "The DD description defines a ratio against the complementary set."
imas-codex sn run --focus equilibrium/time_slice/.../quantity
```

`sn run` uses the configured `[tool.imas-codex.sn-compose]` model by default;
an explicit `--compose-model` remains a run-scoped override. Focus routing
fences the worklist, while the ordinary compose, validation, review, and
persistence gates remain authoritative.

### Validation gating

`validation_status` is independent of review and gates names before review,
consolidation, or export:

| Status | Set by | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `pending` | PERSIST phase | Default; awaiting validation |
| `valid` | VALIDATE phase | Passed critical checks; eligible downstream |
| `quarantined` | VALIDATE phase | Failed a critical check; excluded |

**Critical (→ quarantine):** grammar round-trip failure, Pydantic construction
error, detected ambiguity. **Non-critical (→ valid):** semantic warnings,
description-quality hints — recorded in `validation_issues`, surfaced to the
reviewer, but never quarantine.

## Graph Persistence

**Module:** `imas_codex/standard_names/graph_ops.py`.

### Write semantics

- **`write_standard_names()` (build path):** `coalesce(b.field, sn.field)` for
  all fields — passing `None` preserves existing data. Persists
  `validation_issues` and `validation_layer_summary`. Safe for re-runs:
  imported catalog data is never clobbered by a subsequent `sn run`.
- **Catalog fold-back (`sn approve`):** reviewed curator edits from a merged
  catalog PR are folded back into the ledger — catalog-owned editorial fields
  are authoritative; graph-only fields (embedding, model, generated_at) are
  preserved. Restoring the graph from a published catalog is a separate
  diff-by-id reconcile (`catalog_reconcile.reconcile_catalog`) that MATCHes
  every entry by id (never recreating nodes) and replays each entry's
  `sources:` block to rebuild provenance.
- **Review write path:** each RD-quorum cycle persists its `Review` nodes
  immediately; `update_review_aggregates` then mirrors final axis scores onto
  the SN slots.
- **Conflict-detecting writes:** before writing, the build path checks for unit
  conflicts and filters out (does not overwrite) any entry whose unit differs
  from an existing node's.

The build path calls shared `_write_standard_name_edges(gc, names)` as a tail
pass after node MERGE; forward-reference targets are MERGEd as bare placeholder
nodes.

### Structural edges

| Edge | From → To | Source / Derivation |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| `HAS_ARGUMENT` | derived SN → parent SN | ISN parser: outermost unary prefix/postfix or projection layer; props `{operator, operator_kind, [role, separator, axis, shape]}` |
| `HAS_PARENT` | child SN → parent SN | ISN grammar peel; direction matches `(IMASNode)-[:HAS_PARENT]->(IMASNode)`; props `{operator, operator_kind, …}`. Emitted only when the parent passes the admission gate (`_filter_admissible_parents`). |
| `MAGNITUDE_OF` | magnitude SN → vector SN | Passive; only when a sourced SN composes to `magnitude_of_<X>` and `<X>` is an admitted vector parent. |
| `HAS_ERROR` | inner SN → uncertainty sibling | ISN parser: `upper_/lower_/uncertainty_index` prefix; direction inverted; `{error_type}` |
| `HAS_PREDECESSOR` / `HAS_SUCCESSOR` | SN → SN | `predecessor`/`successor` (pipeline) or `deprecates`/`superseded_by` (catalog) |
| `IN_CLUSTER` | SN → `IMASSemanticCluster` | `primary_cluster_id` |
| `HAS_PHYSICS_DOMAIN` | SN → `PhysicsDomain` | `physics_domain` slug → seeded singleton |
| `HAS_UNIT` | SN → `Unit` | `unit` (both paths) |
| `HAS_COCOS` | SN → `COCOS` | `cocos` integer (pipeline path) |
| `REFINED_FROM` | new SN → predecessor SN | `persist_refined_name`; source edges (`PRODUCED_NAME`, `HAS_STANDARD_NAME`) migrate to the new SN in the same transaction |
| `DOCS_REVISION_OF` | SN → `DocsRevision` | `persist_refined_docs`; snapshots prior docs+reviewer state before in-place rewrite |

`HAS_ARGUMENT` / `HAS_ERROR` derivation lives in
`imas_codex/standard_names/derivation.py` (`derive_edges(name)`, pure logic).
Each name is peeled one layer only; the inner name runs its own derivation when
written. Unparseable names silently produce no derived edges.

### Source-tracking relationships

```
(IMASNode)-[:HAS_STANDARD_NAME]->(StandardName)
(FacilitySignal)-[:HAS_STANDARD_NAME]->(StandardName)
(StandardNameSource)-[:FROM_DD_PATH]->(IMASNode)
(StandardNameSource)-[:FROM_SIGNAL]->(FacilitySignal)
(StandardNameSource)-[:PRODUCED_NAME]->(StandardName)
```

### Cost & budget

Cost is graph-backed via `LLMCost` nodes written async by `BudgetManager`.
`SNRun.status`: `started → completed | interrupted | failed | degraded`. The
only charge API is `lease.charge_event(cost, event)`. Every paid request goes
directly to OpenRouter with `provider.max_price` set to either the bundled
catalog's tighter known rates or an immutable model-independent policy ceiling.
This keeps newly configured production seats bounded when the local catalog
lags. Proxy routes and cataloged prices with unbounded text, media, search,
time, or reasoning dimensions fail before dispatch. The lease prices a known
model's full input context; uncataloged models reserve a conservative immutable
input ceiling and reject requests whose serialized text and response schema do
not fit. It also covers the configured output allowance (including
length-retry growth), request fee, every wrapper attempt, outer retry, fan-out
request, and concurrent reservation. This makes a provider charge beyond the
lease unreachable: a route whose advertised rate exceeds the request ceiling
is not executed. Completed structured-call failures carry aggregate retry
telemetry and are charged once before their handler releases unused headroom.
Start the manager with `await shared_mgr.start()`;
finalize each run with `drain_pending()` + `get_total_spent()` in a `finally`
block. (LLMCost node properties and canonical cost queries are documented in
`AGENTS.md` → Graph Operations.)

## PR-Driven Round-Trip

The graph is authoritative for pipeline state; the catalog (ISNC) is
authoritative for human-reviewed editorial fields.

```
sn release --export-only → sn preview → sn release -m "msg" → GitHub Pages / PR review → PR merged → sn approve
```

1. **`sn release --export-only`** — runs only the export leg: reads validated
   SN nodes, applies quality gates (`reviewer_score_name ≥ 0.65` + description
   sub-score), writes YAML to `<staging>/standard_names/<domain>/<name>.yml`
   (default staging `~/.cache/imas-codex/staging`) and stops (no tag/push).
2. **`sn preview`** — auto-exports and launches a local MkDocs dev server via
   ISN's CatalogRenderer. `--no-export` serves an existing staging dir. Tunnel:
   `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 <host>`.
3. **`sn release -m "msg"`** — auto-exports, copies staging YAML into the ISNC
   checkout, commits, tags the next semver, pushes. RC → origin (fork); final
   (`--final`) → upstream. The tag push triggers ISNC CI → GitHub Pages. For
   custom filtering, run `sn release --export-only` (with the `[export]`
   scoping flags) first, then `--skip-export`.
4. **PR review on GitHub** — edits description, documentation, tags, kind,
   links, status, etc. Merged to ISNC main.
5. **`sn approve`** — folds the reviewed curator edits from the merged catalog
   PR back into the ledger: catalog-owned editorial fields overwrite the graph
   node and `origin` flips to `catalog_edit` on any name whose
   `PROTECTED_FIELDS` were edited. It attaches to existing names by id and
   never recreates nodes or provenance.

**Graph restore (separate path).** Rebuilding the graph from a published
catalog is *not* the fold-back path: it is the diff-by-id reconciler
`catalog_reconcile.reconcile_catalog`, which MATCHes each entry by id (a
missing node is reported, never recreated), updates only diverging scalar
editorial fields, and replays each entry's `sources:` block through the
provenance-rebuild binder to restore `StandardNameSource` + `PRODUCED_NAME`.
The read-only `check_catalog` divergence report
(`imas_codex/standard_names/catalog_import.py`) compares catalog-vs-graph
without writing.

**Protection model:** `PROTECTED_FIELDS` = {description, documentation, kind,
tags, links, status, deprecates, superseded_by, validity_domain, constraints}.
Pipeline writers call `filter_protected()` before graph writes — `catalog_edit`
names have these stripped from pipeline updates unless `override=True` or the
name is in `override_names` (`sn run --override-edits <name>`, repeatable).

**Idempotent by construction:** both the fold-back and the reconcile paths key
on the name id and never create `StandardName` nodes, so re-running the same
catalog state is a no-op — no watermark or lock is needed.

## Scoped Runs Without Global Maintenance

Ordinary `sn run` behavior is unchanged: it performs the graph-wide startup
reconcilers, background orphan and embedding workers, and post-drain structural,
link, and family maintenance around the seven worker pools. For an operator who
needs a run to write only an explicitly stamped scope, add
`--skip-global-maintenance` to `--focus`/`--batch` or `--scope-run-id`. The run
still uses the normal generate, validation, review, refine, and documentation
pools with strict claims, quorum acceptance, shared cost accounting, and an
audited `SNRun`; only the global maintenance writers are bypassed. Focus seeding
and `run_id` stamping remain limited to the requested DD paths.

The option fails closed without one of those explicit scopes and with
`--reseed`, `--reset-to`/`--reset-only`, `--revalidate`, family or campaign
modes, and maintenance-only `--only reconcile|attach|validate|link` runs. It is
available only for the DD pool orchestrator. With `--dry-run`, the CLI validates
and reports the bounded scope, performs no graph writes, and does not start
pools.

## Reset & Clear Semantics

- **`sn run --reset-to {drafted|extracted}`** — re-process existing nodes
  (`drafted`) or clear matching SN nodes for a full re-run (`extracted`). Clears
  transient fields (embedding, model, generated_at) and removes
  `HAS_STANDARD_NAME` / `HAS_UNIT` edges. Scoped to `--source`; narrow with
  `--since`, `--before`, `--below-score`, `--tier`, `--retry-quarantined`.
- **`sn run --reset-only`** — perform the cleanup then exit (requires
  `--reset-to`).
- **`sn run --from-model <substring>`** — re-generate names produced by a
  specific model.
- **`sn clear`** — full-subsystem wipe (SN + Review + StandardNameSource +
  VocabGap + SNRun + grammar tree) with auto re-seed from ISN. No scoping.
- **`sn prune`** — relationship-first safe delete. Requires `--stage` or
  `--all`; `--include-sources` also drops StandardNameSource nodes.
- **Grammar sync is automatic** — `sn run` syncs the installed ISN grammar
  into the graph at startup when the active version differs (idempotent
  no-op otherwise; best-effort — a sync failure logs and continues), and
  `sn clear` re-seeds it after a wipe (`--no-reseed` to skip).

**Chain history is permanent.** `--reset-to` leaves `REFINED_FROM` chains and
`DocsRevision` snapshots in place. **Safety guard:** `--reset-to` and
`sn prune` require `--include-accepted` to touch `name_stage=accepted`
names (catalog-authoritative). `sn clear` has no such guard.

## Family Harmonization

Docs are generated per-name, so sibling families (a vector's projections,
per-locus / per-species / per-zone variants) can drift apart in their
documentation structure even when each member individually passes review.
Two mechanisms address this:

**In-pipeline (always on).** `fetch_sibling_family()` (`context.py`) injects
each name's HAS_PARENT family — parent, anchor, live members with their doc
openings — into the generate_docs, review_docs and refine_docs prompts. The
family = children sharing a parent via `operator_kind ∈ {projection,
qualifier, coordinate, locus}`; the anchor (template authority) is the parent
when its docs are accepted and real, else the best-scored docs-accepted
member. All three prompts carry a parallel-structure directive: one opening
noun-phrase template per family, varying only member-specific tokens, symbols
and genuinely member-specific physics — faithfulness outranks uniformity, so
distinct per-member physics (e.g. an unsigned radial mode index next to
signed Fourier harmonics) must never be flattened. The review rubric docks
description/documentation quality for gratuitous template divergence from
accepted siblings, citing the sibling ids.

**Link-integrity gate (accept path).** `persist_reviewed_docs` scans an
accepting doc's markdown links: a `[label](name:target)` whose snake_cased
label is itself an existing StandardName id different from the target is a
referencing error reviewers systematically miss. The doc is demoted to
`reviewed` (score clamped under the accept threshold) with a
`link_integrity` per-dimension comment listing the mismatches, so the next
refine pass fixes the labels. At the rotation cap the doc accepts anyway —
a link nit never exhausts a doc.

**Idempotent done-state (automatic).** Each family carries
`harmonized_at` + `harmonized_group_signature` (a sha256 over sorted live
member ids and per-member content hashes) on members and parent. Every
`sn run` post-drain reconcile calls `restamp_harmonized_families()`: families
whose live members are ALL docs-accepted get a fresh stamp when membership
or content changed; families with any non-accepted member wait for a later
run. A new sibling composing therefore updates its family's stamp
automatically once its docs pass review — no operator action.

**Curative wave (`sn run --families`).** For docs accepted with drifted or
defective content, `sn run --families "<parent …>" --include-accepted` is a
one-shot wave: it resolves each parent's live family, snapshots every
member's docs to a `DocsRevision` (same `{id}#rev-{chain}` scheme as
refine), resets the family's docs pipeline, drains ONLY those names through
the docs pools (docs-only flush, scoped internally), and the post-drain
reconcile restamps. `--dry-run` previews the member set. The deterministic
drift metric (first-6-token opening signature; drift = 1 − max_cohort/n)
counts member-specific tokens as drift and therefore over-flags — treat
`sn status`'s drift worklist as a RANKING and confirm genuine structural
drift (LLM triage or human read) before re-opening accepted docs.

**Inspection.** `sn status` prints the Sibling Families block (counts,
stamped, awaiting docs, drift worklist + top entries);
`sn status --family <seed>` prints one assembled family (parent, anchor,
members). The `harmonize.py` library (`build_worklist`, `assemble_family`,
`lint_links`, `mark_families_for_regen`, `restamp_harmonized_families`)
remains the programmatic surface.


## Edit Side-Car

`imas-codex sn edit <standard_name>` lets a human or agent attach a proposed
correction to an existing StandardName's name or docs as a **steered
candidate** that rides the normal generate→review→score pipeline, instead of
mutating graph text directly (which bypasses grammar validation, RD-quorum
review, and scoring). A mirrored MCP write tool (`edit_standard_name`)
exposes the same operation to agents; both share one implementation,
`imas_codex.standard_names.edit.apply_edit`.

```
imas-codex sn edit <standard_name> (--hint TEXT | --rename NAME | --docs TEXT) --reason TEXT
                   [--axis name|docs|both] [--scope self|family|subtree] [--dry-run]
```

### Two-mode entry

The schema's `EditMode` has three values, grouped by how much of the
pipeline they skip:

- **hint** — a direction is injected into `generate_name`/`refine_name`
  (`name_hint`) or `generate_docs`/`refine_docs` (`docs_hint`) as additional
  steering context; the pipeline still composes the candidate. `--axis`
  selects which slot(s) the hint populates (name, docs, or both).
- **rename** / **docs** — `name_hint` or `docs_hint` carries a full
  replacement value that skips generation entirely; the proposed value rides
  straight into `REVIEW_NAME` / `REVIEW_DOCS`.

### Reason-to-review mechanic

`edit_reason` is mandatory whenever `edit_mode` is set. It is injected into
the generate/refine prompts (hint mode) **and** into the review gate (every
mode) as intent context: "a domain expert has deliberately steered this
candidate for the following reason: …; judge on merits given this intent; do
not penalize merely for differing from a prior variant." This exists because
the reviewer LLM measurably pulls back toward previously-accepted variants —
without intent context, a deliberate correction reads as unexplained
divergence from the prior candidate and gets marked down for it. Review
still scores independently on the rubric and **can reject the edit
outright**; the reason neutralizes the revert bias, it does not pre-approve.

### Schema fields (`standard_name.yaml`)

| Field | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `edit_mode` | `EditMode` (`hint`\|`rename`\|`docs`) | Null when no edit attached |
| `name_hint` | string | Direction (hint) or full replacement (rename) for the name axis |
| `docs_hint` | string | Direction (hint) or full replacement (docs) for the docs axis |
| `edit_reason` | string | Mandatory justification; shown to generate/refine + review |
| `edit_origin` | `EditOrigin` (`human`\|`agent`) | Who proposed the edit |
| `edit_status` | `EditStatus` | `open → applied \| exhausted \| rejected` |
| `edit_scope` | `EditScope` (`only_self`\|`family`\|`subtree`) | Blast radius, recorded at attach time for the cascade |
| `edit_requested_at` | datetime | ISO 8601 timestamp at attach |

**`edit_status` lifecycle:** `open` (attached, riding the pipeline, outcome
undetermined) → `applied` (steered candidate accepted by review — terminal)
\| `exhausted` (refine rotation cap hit first — terminal) \| `rejected`
(scored below threshold with no rotation left, or terminally rejected by an
editor — terminal). Surfaced in `sn status`.

### Scope and cascade

`edit_scope` sets the blast radius: `only_self` (CLI accepts `self` — a
permissible_value literally named `self` crashes the LinkML/jsonasobj2
loader via an `ExtendedNamespace` kwarg collision with the `self` positional
parameter), `family` (this SN + siblings sharing the edited segment,
triggering parent re-derivation), or `subtree` (this SN as parent + every
`HAS_PARENT` descendant). Defaults: parent → `subtree`, leaf → `self`. A leaf
edit that changes a base segment shared with siblings is **blocked** without
explicit `--scope family` — the sibling-desync guard, preventing one
sibling's rename from silently diverging from the rest of its family.

The cascade is **root-gated and atomic**: the root rename is the single
reviewed decision; descendant renames are deterministic (ISN grammar peel)
and ISN-round-trip-validated, and are applied only once the root's review
accepts (`edit_status → applied`). No half-edited families — either the full
cascade lands in one transaction or none of it does.

### Provenance: `edit_origin` vs implicit reviewer origin

`edit_origin` (`human`\|`agent`) records who *requested* the steering via
`sn edit` — set only when an edit is attached. This is distinct from
`reviewer_suggested_name`, which is always LLM-authored: the reviewer's own
alternative suggestion produced as a byproduct of scoring a candidate, not
requested by an editor. An edit's `name_hint`/`docs_hint` is the deliberate
proposal under review; `reviewer_suggested_name` is the reviewer's incidental
counter-proposal.

Eligible rename targets include terminal-stage names with no successor: a
`superseded` name with no successor edge (an orphaned DD path) can be
resurrected by a redesign edit. Editing runs through `sn edit` to attach the
candidate, then a subsequent `sn run` (or `sn review`) rotation to drive it
through review.

`sn bench` uses the same prompt pipeline as `sn run` (system/user split via
`build_compose_context()`). Model lists default from
`[tool.imas-codex.sn-benchmark]`. The output table includes a **Cache %**
column (provider-side via OpenRouter). Scoring is 6-dimensional (see
[Scoring](#scoring)).

| `search_standard_names` | Semantic + keyword search; filters: `kind`, `physics_domain`, `name_stage`, `cocos_type`, `k`, and exact per-segment grammar filters (`physical_base`, `subject`, `component`, `coordinate`, `position`, `process`, `region`, `geometric_base`, `device`) |
| `fetch_standard_names` | Fetch full entries by name ID (space/comma separated) |
| `list_standard_names` | List with `physics_domain` / `kind` / `name_stage` / `cocos_type` filters |
| `list_grammar_vocabulary` | Distinct tokens + usage counts for a grammar segment |

Grammar-segment filters match exactly against the parsed `sn.<segment>`
property — use `list_grammar_vocabulary` to discover valid tokens first. The
`physics_domain` filter (canonical scalar + `source_domains` list) is pushed
into Cypher in all three search branches, so it does not lose results below
`LIMIT $k`.

## Architecture Boundary

ISN owns grammar, vocabulary, and validation; codex owns the pipeline,
evaluation, and graph persistence. Full detail in [`boundary.md`](boundary.md).

**Import boundary** (ISN ≥0.8.0rc7) — the only public surface codex imports:
`get_grammar_context()` (single entry point, 19 keys),
`create_standard_name_entry()` (Pydantic), `run_semantic_checks()`,
`validate_description()`, `parse_standard_name()` / `compose_standard_name()`
(round-trip). Never import ISN private modules. Never hardcode grammar rules —
pull from `get_grammar_context()`. Review criteria live in codex
(`sn_review_criteria.yaml`).

## Grammar Vocabulary

Closed-vocabulary system: **physical bases** (~78, irreducible dimensional
quantities, CI-gated), **qualifiers** (~92, prefix modifiers stripped
recursively by the parser), **processes** (~90, suffix-only via
`_due_to_{token}`). All segments — including `physical_base` (~100 tokens) —
have closed vocabularies defined in ISN's `SEGMENT_TOKEN_MAP`.

**Composition order:** `{subject}_{qualifier1}_{qualifier2}_{physical_base}_{due_to_process}`.

**Rules:** (1) Never add compounds to `physical_bases` — use qualifiers.
(2) Qualifier order is insertion-order, preserved through round-trip.
(3) Role resolution assigns subject tokens to the dedicated subject segment
rather than the generic qualifier segment. (4) Process
tokens as prefixes are qualifiers, not processes. Never hardcode vocabulary
tokens in Python — pull from ISN.

**VocabGap nodes** record missing grammar tokens from composition (linked via
`HAS_SN_VOCAB_GAP` from `IMASNode`/`FacilitySignal`; carry segment, token,
reason). Pseudo segments like `grammar_ambiguity` are filtered at write time
(`imas_codex.standard_names.segments.filter_closed_segment_gaps`); reviewers
audit the `physical_base` slot via the decomposition rule
(`sn_review_criteria.yaml` I4.6). `VocabGap` nodes accumulate automatically
during composition; query them directly from the graph when assembling an ISN
vocabulary rotation. A compose-time component-token reuse check
(`vocab_semantic_dedup.nearest_registered_token`, threshold
`[sn-compose].dedup-similarity-threshold`) flags a proposed new token that is a
near-synonym of a registered same-segment token and chains a refine so the
agent reuses it or confirms it distinct — the confirmation is stamped on the
`VocabGap` (`dedup_decision`) so the rotation does not re-litigate it.

### Vocabulary rotation — ISN fork RC workflow

When rotations surface `VocabGap` nodes blocked by the current ISN vocabulary,
add tokens on the fork (`~/Code/imas-standard-names` →
`Simon-McIntosh/IMAS-Standard-Names`) and cut an RC release. Upstream is
`iterorganization/IMAS-Standard-Names`; the dep in imas-codex pins to a git tag
on the fork, so RC tags on origin suffice.

**Vocab-addition rules** (apply *before* editing YAML):

- Every legitimate physics quantity deserves a token regardless of frequency.
  Classify each gap first: TRUE_GAP (add), COMPOSE_ERROR (fix the prompt
  instead), REJECT (not a valid grammar concept).
- Single-word base preferred; physical-quantity semantics only; no overlap with
  existing tokens; not a unit or geometry primitive.
- **No compound tokens that subsume `physical_base` words** —
  `trapped_particle` as a subject greedily consumes "particle" and breaks
  grouping with `particle_density`. Use `trapped` alone.
- **Prefer atomic qualifiers.** Orbit class (`trapped`, `co_passing`) and
  species (`fast_particle`, `electron`) are independent axes — never combine.
- **Grouping invariant:** all orbit/species variants of the same physical
  quantity MUST parse to the same `physical_base`.
- **Round-trip every existing name** containing the candidate string:
  `assert compose_standard_name(parse_standard_name(name)) == name`.

**Release procedure:**

```bash
cd ~/Code/imas-standard-names
uv run pytest && git push origin main           # edit vocab YAML, test, commit
uv run standard-names release status            # inspect state-machine state
uv run standard-names release -m "feat: ..."    # increment RC (NEVER tag manually)
# --bump minor/major starts a new series; --final finalizes to upstream.

cd ~/Code/imas-codex                            # bump the dep (appears twice)
sed -i 's|@v0\.8\.0rc[0-9]\+|@v0.8.0rc<NN>|g' pyproject.toml
uv sync && uv run pytest tests/standard_names/ -x
git commit -am "deps: bump imas-standard-names to v0.8.0rc<NN>" && git push origin main
```

Multi-RC chains are normal during bootstrap. Re-rotate vocab-bound domains
after each bump to measure lift.
