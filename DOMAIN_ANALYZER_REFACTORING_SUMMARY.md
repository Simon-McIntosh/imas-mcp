# Domain Analyzer Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully extracted hardcoded definitions from the `domain_analyzer.py` file and organized them into structured YAML files in the `imas_mcp/definitions/physics/domains/` folder.

## Files Created

### 1. `measurement_types.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Defines measurement types, their identification keywords, and description templates
- **Content**:
  - Measurement type definitions (density, temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc.)
  - Identification keywords for path-based classification
  - Template descriptions that can be formatted with domain names
  - Typical units for each measurement type

### 2. `diagnostic_methods.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Defines diagnostic methods, their descriptions, outputs, and domain applicability
- **Content**:
  - Diagnostic method definitions (Thomson scattering, ECE, MSE, etc.)
  - Physics context descriptions
  - Typical measurement outputs
  - High applicability domains
  - Applicability assessment rules and domain defaults

### 3. `physics_contexts.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Defines theoretical physics contexts, equations, scales, and parameters
- **Content**:
  - Theoretical contexts for each domain
  - Fundamental equations
  - Physics scales (spatial and temporal)
  - Governing parameters
  - Typical operating regimes
  - Domain relationship types and physics connections

### 4. `research_workflows.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Defines research applications, standard workflows, and analysis approaches
- **Content**:
  - Research applications by domain
  - Standard physics workflows (equilibrium reconstruction, transport analysis)
  - Generic workflow templates
  - Analysis approach recommendations based on complexity
  - Data quality recommendations

## Code Changes

### Key Refactoring Points

1. **Added YAML loading methods** in `__init__()` to load all definition files
2. **Replaced hardcoded dictionaries** with YAML-based lookups
3. **Updated method signatures** to use loaded definitions
4. **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing API
5. **Added error handling** for missing YAML files

### Methods Refactored

- `_identify_measurement_type()` - Now uses YAML keyword matching
- `_describe_measurement()` - Uses YAML templates with domain formatting
- `_describe_measurement_method()` - Loads descriptions from YAML
- `_get_method_outputs()` - Gets outputs from YAML definitions
- `_assess_method_applicability()` - Uses YAML applicability rules
- `_build_theoretical_context()` - Loads context from YAML
- `_classify_domain_relationship()` - Uses YAML relationship definitions
- `_describe_physics_connection()` - Loads connections from YAML
- `_extract_workflows()` - Uses YAML workflow definitions
- `_get_fundamental_equations()` - Loads equations from YAML
- `_get_physics_scales()` - Loads scales from YAML
- `_get_governing_parameters()` - Loads parameters from YAML
- `_get_typical_regimes()` - Loads regimes from YAML
- `_identify_research_applications()` - Uses YAML applications
- `_generate_quality_recommendations()` - Uses YAML recommendations

## Benefits

### 1. **Maintainability**

- Physics definitions are now in easily editable YAML files
- No need to modify code to update physics knowledge
- Clear separation of data and logic

### 2. **Extensibility**

- Easy to add new measurement types, diagnostic methods, or domains
- Template-based approach allows for consistent formatting
- Modular structure supports incremental updates

### 3. **Consistency**

- All physics definitions follow the same YAML structure
- Consistent metadata and versioning across files
- Standardized naming conventions

### 4. **Documentation**

- YAML files serve as documentation of physics knowledge
- Clear structure makes domain expertise accessible
- Metadata tracks source and version information

### 5. **Reusability**

- YAML definitions can be used by other modules
- Physics knowledge is centralized and shareable
- Consistent with existing patterns in the codebase

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass (341 tests successful)
- Created verification script that confirms:
  - YAML definitions load correctly
  - Measurement identification works with new system
  - Template-based descriptions function properly
  - Diagnostic method information is accessible
  - Physics context data is available

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add validation schemas** for YAML files to ensure consistency
2. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed definitions
3. **Add configuration options** for custom definition paths
4. **Create tools** for easy editing and validation of physics definitions
5. **Extend coverage** to include more specialized physics domains

## Files Modified

- `imas_mcp/physics_extraction/domain_analyzer.py` - Refactored to use YAML definitions
- Added import for `load_definition_file` from `imas_mcp.definitions`

## Files Added

- `imas_mcp/definitions/physics/domains/measurement_types.yaml`
- `imas_mcp/definitions/physics/domains/diagnostic_methods.yaml`
- `imas_mcp/definitions/physics/domains/physics_contexts.yaml`
- `imas_mcp/definitions/physics/domains/research_workflows.yaml`
- `test_domain_analyzer_yaml.py` (verification script)

This refactoring successfully separates physics domain knowledge from code logic, making the system more maintainable, extensible, and easier to update as physics understanding evolves.
