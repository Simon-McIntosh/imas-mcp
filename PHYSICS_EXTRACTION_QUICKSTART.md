# Quick Start: Physics Extraction Implementation

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

Since the physics extraction system infrastructure is already built but not yet used, here are the immediate steps to get it operational:

### Step 1: Test Current System (30 minutes)

```bash
# Test with a small sample
python -m imas_mcp.physics_extraction extract --max-ids 1 --paths-per-ids 5

# Check what was extracted
python -m imas_mcp.physics_extraction export --output test_extraction.json
```

### Step 2: Enable Real AI Integration (2-4 hours)

1. **Add OpenAI API Configuration**:

   ```python
   # In imas_mcp/physics_extraction/extractors.py
   import openai

   class AIPhysicsExtractor:
       def __init__(self, api_key: str = None):
           self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
   ```

2. **Replace Mock AI Response**:
   Current code uses mock data - replace with real API calls in `_analyze_path_with_ai()`

3. **Test with Real AI**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
   python -m imas_mcp.physics_extraction extract --max-ids 2 --paths-per-ids 10
   ```

### Step 3: Process Sample IDS (1-2 hours)

- Extract from 5-10 representative IDS
- Validate output quality
- Estimate costs for full processing

### Step 4: Basic Integration (2-3 hours)

- Add physics extraction database as data source in physics_integration.py
- Create simple fallback when manual domains don't have info
- Test with existing MCP tools

## Why This Matters

The physics extraction system could provide:

1. **10x More Physics Coverage**: Instead of 22 manual domains, get hundreds of specific physics quantities
2. **Automated Discovery**: Find physics concepts in obscure IDS that manual curation missed
3. **Validation**: Cross-check manual domains against AI-extracted physics
4. **Rich Context**: Provide detailed physics descriptions for every unit and quantity

## Resource Requirements

- **Time**: 1-2 days for basic implementation, 1-2 weeks for full integration
- **Cost**: ~$50-100 for processing all 83 IDS with OpenAI API
- **Skills**: Python development, basic AI/ML understanding

## Expected Outcome

After implementation:

- Extract 500-1000 physics quantities from IMAS data
- Enhance physics explanations with real IMAS examples
- Improve search accuracy for physics-related queries
- Provide automated validation of manual physics domains
