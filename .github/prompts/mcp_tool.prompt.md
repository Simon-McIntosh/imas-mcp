Implement phase {phase} of the . fix explore_identifiers tool. These are mcp tools that are accessed via the imas mcp server. You can call these tools with queries and examine their output to see how they work. if you update code then the imas-debug server specified in the mcp.json file will need to be restarted for these changes to take effect. Work through plan steps sequentially writing pytests for fixes / new features along the way. mark progres on plan. Validate and check off success metrics once done. use vscode test explorer to run tests.

Define the task to achieve, including specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria.
