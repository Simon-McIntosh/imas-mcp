"""A rename moves an identity; it must not silently unpublish its document.

``persist_refined_name`` mints the successor of every renamed StandardName and
copies the predecessor's description onto it. Documentation is the other half
of the same prose and was dropped, so a re-rendering of an already-documented
quantity landed as an undocumented node with its docs axis reset — the text
was written about a meaning that had not changed.

These tests pin both halves of the rule. Documentation and the whole docs
lifecycle travel when the two spellings parse to the same grammar IR, and they
do not travel otherwise: a name that says something else must not inherit an
accepted document asserting what nobody wrote about it.
