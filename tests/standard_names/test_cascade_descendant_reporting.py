"""Report-vs-persistence contract for descendant rename cascades.

A subtree or family rename must report a descendant rename as *performed*
only when the cascade actually persists it.  When the rename root has not
reached ``accepted`` the descendants are deferred work: the report carries
them as a plan that awaits the root's acceptance, and they are never
written.  When the root does reach ``accepted`` the report carries the
persisted renames and they are written exactly as the result describes.

The discriminating field is ``CascadeResult.dry_run``: ``True`` on every
non-apply return path (early refusal, conflict, mismatch, deferred plan) and
``False`` only where the renames were actually persisted.  A caller can
therefore tell planned-and-performed (False) from planned-and-deferred
(True) without reading the graph.  The measured failure this guards: a root
exhausted below the acceptance threshold left its descendants reported as
planned work that was never performed.

The accepted-root assertions pin the persistence behaviour so the
honest-report contract cannot be fixed by silently stopping the writes.

Runs against the in-memory ``FakeGraph`` from ``test_edit_engine`` — no live
Neo4j.
