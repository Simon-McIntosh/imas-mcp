"""The name-review prompt must not hand-write operator placement rules.

Operator placement is a rendering rule owned by the ISN composer: an operator
whose operand carries an ``_of_`` / ``_at_`` / ``_due_to_`` locus tail renders
between the base group and that tail, and a name with no tail keeps its natural
prefix reading. Prose in a review prompt that states a fixed prefix-``_of_`` /
postfix-append convention is a second source of truth for that rule, and it
diverges the moment the renderer changes -- reviewers then propose the spelling
the composer will not produce.

The round-trip criterion (``parse(name) -> compose() == name``) already checks
placement against the live renderer, so it must survive.
