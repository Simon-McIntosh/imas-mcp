"""Cascade-atomicity tests for edit-rename acceptance.

Locked decision: every descendant id produced by a rename cascade is
round-trip-validated and uniqueness-checked BEFORE the cascade commits; any
failure refuses the acceptance itself — the root is not accepted and no
descendant is renamed (full rollback, nothing persisted).  The auto-commit
graph primitive cannot span the acceptance write and the rename write in a
single Neo4j transaction, so atomicity is realised by gating the acceptance
on a clean cascade preflight (see
:func:`imas_codex.standard_names.graph_ops.persist_reviewed_name`).

The report-vs-persistence contract closes the gap that gating leaves open:
a cascade that is NOT applied must not read as performed.  ``CascadeResult.
dry_run`` is ``True`` on every non-apply return path and ``False`` only where
the descendant renames were actually persisted, so the two halves of the
contract are (a) an accepted root persists exactly the descendants it
reports, and (b) a root that has not reached ``accepted`` reports its
descendants as awaiting acceptance and changes no id.  The plain-language
deferral wording the surface prints from ``dry_run`` is pinned in
``test_rename_cascade.py``'s ``TestDeferredCascadeIsReportedAsDeferred``.

Runs against the in-memory ``FakeGraph`` from ``test_edit_engine`` — no live
Neo4j.
