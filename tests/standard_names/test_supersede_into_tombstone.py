"""Folding an identity onto a tombstoned spelling that nothing else reads.

A superseded name with no successor, no sources and no parent or child edge is
a free identity: the spelling is dead and the fold may re-occupy it. Anything
that still reads the spelling — a recorded successor, a successor lineage edge,
a bound source, a parent or a child — keeps the fold refused, and a target in a
live stage other than ``accepted`` stays refused as before.
