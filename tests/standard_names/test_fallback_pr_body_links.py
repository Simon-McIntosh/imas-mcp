"""The deterministic fallback PR body must link the catalog reviewing guide.

A reviewer who reaches the fallback body never sees the catalog document
that states which fields they may edit unless the body carries it, and the
release workflow's posted-body gate asserts the substring ``REVIEWING.md``
(the ``gh api ... .body | contains`` check). The link must be a named
markdown link, never a bare URL, so it stays readable and clickable in the
review column.

The address itself is derived from the catalog checkout's github ``origin``
remote rather than spelled as literal owner and repository, so it follows the
release target and raises instead of composing a link that would 404 when the
remote cannot be resolved. The derivation mirrors
``exclusion_ledger_blob_url``: resolve the checkout, parse the origin slug,
and raise rather than guess.
