"""The claim adapter lets a priority scope replace, not collide with, its caller's scope.

Under ``--focus`` the docs claim adapters receive ``scope_run_id`` through the
shared scope kwargs; ``generate_docs`` and ``review_docs`` also receive a
priority (drift) scope to try first. The priority pass must run against the
priority scope in place of the caller's scope, not alongside it — passing the
same keyword twice raises ``TypeError`` before the claim function is ever
reached, so a focus run that needs documentation work fails outright instead
of claiming. The caller's own scope still gets its turn on the fallback call
when the priority pass returns nothing.
