"""The fold ambiguity guard reads the change ledger, not the edge alone.

A ``REFINED_FROM`` edge records every succession a rename ever made, including
the ones a later rename revoked. The guard's ambiguity decision -- does some
identity other than the fold target currently claim the source's meaning? --
must therefore come from the ordering of ``StandardNameChange`` rows, not from
the existence of the edge. The current successor of a name is the spelling the
most recent rename or supersede event brought the meaning to, provided that
event was not itself reverted; an event back onto the source means the rename
was reverted and the edge is history, not a live claim.

The canonical case is the normalized beta family. A ``regenerate`` renamed the
normalized identity to ``beta`` at 2026-07-22T13:07:04 and a ``human_edit``
renamed it back three minutes later at 13:10:05, leaving both edges but only
one live meaning. Under the ledger rule ``normalized_toroidal_plasma_beta``
has no current successor other than the fold target, so folding it onto its
canonical spelling is unambiguous -- where the edge-existence reading refused
forever. Every own test here would fail under that older rule, pinning the
decision to the ledger.
