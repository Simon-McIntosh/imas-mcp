"""A fold's dry run reaches the same verdict as its live transaction.

``supersede_into`` answers twice. The dry run evaluates the guard and the
idempotency read, then rolls back and reports a mutation plan. The live path
evaluates the same guard, applies the declared mutations, and proves the
complete post-state equals a receipt computed before any write. A preflight is
only worth running if those two answers agree, so every scalar the mutation
writes must be a scalar the receipt can name.

The modification stamp is the one that cannot be guessed. The name mutation
takes it from ``$changed_at`` -- the single instant the receipt already
declares for the fold's ledger event -- rather than from the transaction clock,
so the expected post-state carries the same value and the proof pins the stamp
exactly instead of comparing an unpredictable one. The stamp reaches five
places in the compared state: each participant's own properties, plus the three
embedded copies of the target's properties carried by its scalar target, its
source binding, and its backing projection.

The harness mirrors the production write here rather than assuming it: the
negative control stamps from an instant the receipt never declared and the
proof must still refuse, because a postflight that passes by ignoring a field
reports a protection it does not provide.
