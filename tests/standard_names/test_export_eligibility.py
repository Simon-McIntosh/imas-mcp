"""Export eligibility of names whose only producers are derived.

A hierarchy parent carries no Data Dictionary source binding: its producers
are the derived children that were folded into it. Withholding it for that
topology alone published the children while their shared parent stayed
invisible to the catalog, so eligibility is decided by the review lifecycle
that governs every other name.
