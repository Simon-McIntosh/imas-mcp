"""Retired (superseded) identities are never selected as export candidates.

A tombstoned identity must stop at the population boundary: it is not part of
the candidate set at all, so the export never drops it and the accounting
never counts it as an exclusion. Both selection queries — the raw candidate
fetch and the accounting population fetch — must carry the same exclusion so
eligibility and the candidate count agree.
