"""A rename moves an identity; the sources that produced it must move with it.

The quantity does not change when its spelling does, so every
``StandardNameSource`` bound to the old name produces the new one. When that
carriage does not happen the failure hides in the one place nobody looks: the
export excludes an unsourced name at the population boundary, so a batch
closes at zero residue with the quantity absent from it and both spellings
holding nothing. Measured on 2026-09-08, a rename of
``power_due_to_ion_cyclotron_heating`` ended with two data-dictionary paths —
``ic_antennas/antenna/power_launched`` and
``summary/heating_current_drive/ic/power/value`` — producing no standard name
at all, and a re-cut of 224 candidates exported 206 with neither spelling in
it.

These tests pin the postcondition rather than the mechanism: count the
``PRODUCED_NAME`` producers the predecessor holds before the rename, count
what the successor holds after, and refuse a successor holding fewer. The
predecessor must claim none of them afterwards either — one source feeding two
live names is its own defect in the other direction.
